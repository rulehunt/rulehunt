#!/usr/bin/env bash
# session-start-handoff.sh - SessionStart hook that surfaces a pending
# /repo:handoff note at the start of a Claude Code session.
#
# Part of Repo Skills (https://github.com/rjwalters/repo), installed by
# install.sh into .claude/skills/repo/hooks/ and wired into the consumer repo's
# .claude/settings.json under hooks.SessionStart (matchers "startup" and
# "resume").
#
# WHY: /repo:handoff writes .claude/handoff.md and adds a pointer line to the
# agent's memory index. That makes the note findable, but nothing announces it,
# and the command's one-shot contract ("read it, then delete it") means a note
# that never gets absorbed lingers silently. handoff.md calls a stale note "a
# trap of its own". This hook makes both facts visible at session start.
#
# =============================================================================
# STABLE INTERFACE (the contract install.sh/uninstall.sh and the tests rely on)
# =============================================================================
#
# Input:  JSON on stdin (Claude Code SessionStart payload). Fields consumed:
#           .cwd    - the session's working directory
#           .source - "startup" | "resume" | "clear" | "compact" | "fork"
#         Anything else in the payload is ignored.
#
# Output: silence + exit 0  => nothing to surface;  otherwise EXACTLY one JSON
#         object on stdout:
#           { "hookSpecificOutput": { "hookEventName": "SessionStart",
#               "additionalContext": "..." } }
#         The "hookEventName" field is REQUIRED by Claude Code's schema -
#         without it the additionalContext is silently discarded.
#
# Exit:   ALWAYS 0, on every path including internal error. SessionStart has no
#         decision control (a hook cannot block session start), so the only
#         thing a failure here can accomplish is noise in the transcript.
#
# Errors: this script MUST never exit non-zero and never emit invalid output.
#         Any internal error is caught by the ERR trap, logged to
#         <script-dir>/../logs/hook-errors.log, and resolves to silence (fail
#         open) - mirroring guard-destructive.sh's convention.
#
# READ-ONLY: this hook never writes, deletes, or modifies .claude/handoff.md or
#         any other file in the repo. Deleting the note after it is absorbed is
#         the /repo:handoff one-shot contract's job, not this hook's. The only
#         file it may ever write is its own diagnostic error log.
#
# SOURCE GATING: only "startup" and "resume" are acted on. install.sh wires
#         exactly those two matchers, and this script re-checks .source anyway
#         so a hand-edited settings.json that routes "clear"/"compact"/"fork"
#         here still no-ops. A /clear is not a process relaunch and the note has
#         not been touched, so repeating the banner there is pure noise.
#
# AUDIENCE GATING (issue #389): the /repo:handoff note is written for the
#         operator's next interactive session, not for autonomous Loom role
#         agents that also start via "startup"/"resume". Two layers guard
#         against a role agent consuming (and, per the one-shot contract,
#         deleting) a note that was never meant for it:
#           Layer 2 - if ${LOOM_ROLE:-} is non-empty (set on daemon-spawned
#             role sessions - see .loom/hooks/methodology-inject.sh), this
#             hook exits silently before reading the note at all.
#           Layer 1 - LOOM_ROLE only covers daemon-spawned sessions, not an
#             interactive `/loom:<role>` invocation, so the injected
#             additionalContext itself conditions the one-shot deletion
#             directive on the reader being the operator's interactive
#             session; an autonomous/role reader is told to leave the note and
#             its MEMORY.md pointer untouched.
#
# SIBLING VISIBILITY (issue #257), opt-in via the environment:
#   REPO_HANDOFF_SIBLING_ROOT - unset/empty (the default) => byte-identical to
#         the behavior above; the hook never looks outside $REPO_ROOT. Set it to
#         a directory that holds your checkouts (e.g. ~/GitHub) and, ONLY when
#         this repo has no pending note of its own, the hook additionally reports
#         which sibling repos directly under that root do have one - PATH AND AGE
#         ONLY, never the body. That closes the gap where "no note here" and "no
#         note anywhere" were indistinguishable at session start: a note written
#         in repo A left no trace readable from repo B.
#         The scan is deliberately bounded and inert: a single level
#         ("$ROOT"/*/.claude/handoff.md), at most MAX_SIBLING_DIRS entries
#         examined, no recursion, no `cd` into a sibling repo, no git
#         invocation, and no write of any kind. A root that is missing,
#         unreadable, or empty of notes resolves to silence, like every other
#         failure path here.

# (capped at MAX_HEADERS) plus a loud oversize warning, bounding the pathological
# case. The 10 KB cap comfortably covers the ~9 KB real-world note that motivated
# the hook, and /repo:handoff's exclusion discipline is designed to keep notes
# short, so the common case inlines.
