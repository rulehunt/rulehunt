# guard-destructive.sh - PreToolUse hook to block destructive agent commands
#
# Part of Repo Skills (https://github.com/rjwalters/repo), and the CANONICAL
# generic destructive-command guard (rjwalters/repo#30): Loom and other tooling
# defer to this copy rather than shipping their own. It is installed by
# install.sh into .claude/skills/repo/hooks/ and wired into the consumer repo's
# .claude/settings.json PreToolUse -> Bash matcher.
#
# Provenance: the precision work in this file (segment parsing, quote-aware
# splitting, literal-text redaction, the read-only fast path, toggles, decision
# telemetry) was developed in rjwalters/loom and consolidated here. Bare issue
# refs like (#3553)/(#3771) refer to rjwalters/loom issues; refs written
# repo#NN refer to rjwalters/repo.
#
# =============================================================================
# STABLE INTERFACE (the contract downstream tools — e.g. Loom — rely on)
# =============================================================================
#
# Input:  JSON on stdin with .tool_input.command and .cwd (Claude Code
#         PreToolUse hook payload). An empty/absent command allows.
# Output: silence + exit 0  => allow;  otherwise a single JSON object:
#   { "hookSpecificOutput": { "hookEventName": "PreToolUse",
#       "permissionDecision": "deny|ask", "permissionDecisionReason": "..." } }
# Exit:   ALWAYS 0, even on deny/ask/internal error. The "hookEventName" field
#         is REQUIRED by Claude Code's schema — without it the decision is
#         silently discarded and the guard becomes inert.
# Errors: this script MUST never exit non-zero or emit invalid output. Any
#         internal error is caught by the ERR trap, logged to
#         <script-dir>/../logs/hook-errors.log, and resolves to allow (fail
#         open) to prevent infinite retry loops in Claude Code.
#
# Config: guards.* keys are read from BOTH config locations —
#           .claude/skills/repo/config.json   (Repo Skills' own; WINS)
#           .loom/config.json                 (legacy/Loom; fallback)
#         Env vars override config; the REPO_* name wins over the legacy
#         LOOM_* name. Both names are a stable part of this interface.

#
# positionalMaskAllowlist is a config-only array of command names (no single
# env var makes sense for a list, mirroring readOnlyFastPathExtra above): each
# entry masks that command's own quoted POSITIONAL arguments in the ASK-tier
# working copy ONLY (never the catastrophic scan), so a read-only tool's own
# search/dedup text is not misread as an ask-triggering phrase (#195). Absent
# or empty (the default) is a no-op. The command words the two DENY-tier
# consumers of that scan recognize as their subject — grep/egrep/fgrep/rg
# (SQL DDL) and cp/mv/tee/sed (#4178 write confinement) — can never be added,
# regardless of config — see mask_ask_positional_args()'s header comment and
# positional_mask_cmdre()'s consumer audit table.
#
# On/off toggles accept 0/false/no and 1/true/yes. rmScope accepts
# repo|off|permissive; forceScope accepts all|protected|off. Loom-compat
# surfaces (the .loom/config.json fallback, LOOM_* env names, and the
# .loom/worktrees rm allowlist) are permanent parts of this contract, not
# transitional shims — Loom installs no generic guard of its own.

# DECISION TELEMETRY (issue #3771) — one JSONL record per deny/ask decision.
#
# Append a machine-readable record to DECISION_LOG each time the guard denies or
# asks, so false-positive friction becomes measurable (which patterns fire, how
# often, before/after a precision fix). Deliberately does NOT log `allow`: the
# #3687 read-only fast path's zero-overhead silent-allow must stay silent, and
# allow-logging would swamp the log with the ~99% common case.
#
# STABLE SCHEMA (the contract #3772's reader/aggregation tooling stacks on — do
# NOT rename fields without considering that dependency), one JSON object per
# line:
#   {"ts":"<UTC>","decision":"deny"|"ask","pattern":"<tag>",
#    "tier":"catastrophic"|"ask","command":"<redacted>","context":"<optional>"}
#     ts       — UTC timestamp, same format as log_hook_error's date -u call.
#     decision — "deny" or "ask".
#     pattern  — a short, stable rule tag (NOT the full free-text reason). For
#                the pattern-array loops it is the matched pattern; the non-loop
#                sites pass a static tag (e.g. "sql-ddl", "rm-protected-path").
#     tier     — "catastrophic" for deny, "ask" for ask.
#     command  — the command string, REDACTED via strip_literal_text() so no raw
#                --body/-m/--title/--notes/--comment secret value is persisted.
#     context  — OPTIONAL free-form diagnostic string, ADDITIVE to the schema
#                (issue #312/rjwalters/loom#312): a call site may pass extra
#                state that a later false-positive review needs but the human-
#                readable permissionDecisionReason never persists anywhere (it
#                is only shown once, inline, in the denied session's own
#                transcript). The `worktree-write-confinement` /
#                `worktree-write-confinement-unresolved-var` tags use it to
#                record the resolved `_WT_MAIN_ROOT` / `_WT_MAIN_ROOT_LOGICAL`
#                roots the containment test actually compared against, so a
#                future audit of this log can tell "the guard resolved an
#                unexpectedly broad root" apart from "the target genuinely
#                sits inside the checkout" WITHOUT reproducing the session.
#                Omitted (absent key, not merely empty-string) when a call site
#                passes none, so every existing record/consumer is unaffected.
#
# Best-effort like log_hook_error: gated by the lazy decision_log_enabled()
# toggle, and a log-write failure (permission denied, disk full, missing dir)
# NEVER changes the deny/ask decision and NEVER causes a non-zero exit. Callers
# invoke it as `log_guard_decision ... || true` so it can never trip the ERR
# trap.

# =============================================================================
# READ-ONLY FAST PATH (issue #3687) — default ON.
#
# guard-destructive.sh is a PreToolUse/Bash hook, so it fires before EVERY Bash
# tool call. In Bash-dense sessions (remote ops, benchmark drivers) the vast
# majority of those calls are obviously read-only — `git status`, `ls`, `grep`,
# `aws … describe*`, `gh … list` — yet each one still runs the full deny/ask
# gauntlet (~37 grep/awk/sed forks + a git rev-parse, ~179ms measured). This
# block short-circuits that overwhelmingly-common case to a silent `allow` with
# a single bash-builtin structural test (zero forks) plus, only when that test
# passes, one lazy `jq` config read.
#
# SECURITY: a fast path is a guard bypass by construction, so admission is
# purely STRUCTURAL and conservative — never content-sensitive:
#   1. Reject fast-path eligibility if the raw command contains ANY of
#      ;  &  |  <  >  backtick  $(  or a newline. This kills chaining, piping,
#      redirection, and command substitution (so `git status && <force-push>`,
#      `git status; rm -rf /`, `git status $(rm -rf /)`, `git status > /etc/x`
#      all fall through to the full path unchanged).
#   2. Exact first-token (command-word) allowlist — never a wrapper. Because the
#      allowlist is keyed on the literal first token, wrapper forms (`bash -c`,
#      `sh -c`, `eval`, `xargs`, `env … git status`, `sudo git status`) are
#      excluded automatically: their first token isn't allowlisted.
#   3. Verb/subcommand exactness for multi-word tools, chosen to be provably
#      disjoint from every existing deny/ask pattern:
#        git status|log|diff|show  (bare — `git -C /p status` is NOT admitted)
#        ls  grep  rg
#        jq  wc  head  tail        (pure read-only text/JSON filters — none has
#          an in-place-mutation flag, so any args are admitted, #3772)
#        test  [  [[               (boolean file/string test builtins — no
#          mutation surface at all, #3772)
#        find                      (admitted for any args EXCEPT when a dangerous
#          action-primary is present: -delete, -exec, -execdir, -ok, -okdir,
#          -fls, -fprint, -fprint0, -fprintf. Any of those disqualifies eligibility
#          and falls through to the full path — structural, not content-scanned,
#          so a future `find -delete` deny rule is never silently bypassed, #3772)
#        gh <noun> view|list       (never delete/close/archive/…)
#        aws <service> describe*|get*|list*  and  aws s3 ls   (mirrors the
#          verb-anchoring already in CLOUD_ASK_PATTERNS: those verbs are never
#          mutating, so this only skips greps that were going to allow anyway)
#   cat and ssh are DELIBERATELY EXCLUDED from the built-in list:
#     - cat has a narrow existing ASK carve-out (cat …/.ssh/, cat …/.aws/
#       credentials); a blanket cat fast-path would silently skip it.
#     - ssh wraps an OPAQUE remote command string that the raw ALWAYS_BLOCK scan
#       still covers today; fast-pathing any `ssh …` would drop that coverage.
#
# False NEGATIVES (declining eligibility) are always safe — they just fall
# through to the correct, slower existing behavior. False POSITIVES are the only
# danger, so the eligibility test stays maximally conservative.
#
# CONFIG-ORDERING CHOICE: this block runs BEFORE REPO_ROOT is resolved (the git
# rev-parse subprocess below), on purpose — the structural test never needs the
# repo root. Only the toggle/extra-list config read needs a config file, and it
# is resolved LAZILY (only after structural admission already passed) by walking
# up from CWD to the nearest guard config (.claude/skills/repo/config.json or
# legacy .loom/config.json) WITHOUT forking git
# (fastpath_config_file). So a fast-pathed command pays: 1 bash-builtin test +
# (only if eligible) 1 stat-walk + 1 jq read — never the git rev-parse, never a
# deny/ask array, never a log write.
#
# Toggle: guards.readOnlyFastPath (default true) / LOOM_GUARD_READONLY_FASTPATH
# env (0/false/no disables, 1/true/yes forces on; env wins). Optional
# guards.readOnlyFastPathExtra is an EXTEND-ONLY array of literal first-word
# commands (each entry is a full-generality bypass for that command word).
# =============================================================================

# cp/mv/tee/sed are exactly the command words extract_write_targets() recognizes
# as write idioms (its `toks[1] == "tee" / "sed" / "cp" / "mv"` scans; `>`/`>>`
# redirection has no command word and is never maskable by construction), so
# excluding them restores the pre-#195 deny in every configuration.
#
# Comparison is on the BASENAME of the configured entry, so a path-qualified

# GENERAL OPERATOR RULE (the invariant this set enforces mechanically for the
# two known deny-tier subjects): only allowlist a command whose positional
# arguments are INERT TEXT it merely reads. A command that ACTS on its
# positional arguments — writes them as paths (cp/mv/tee/sed) or executes them
# as statements (`psql "DROP TABLE …"`, `sh -c "…"`) — must never be
# allowlisted; masking its arguments hides exactly the text a deny-tier scan

# they are NO LONGER in the ungated ASK_PATTERNS array; a repo that still wants
# the confirmation can opt IN here. The genuinely hard-to-reverse ops
# (`gh release delete` — published artifacts/tags; `git clean -fd` / `git

# ask tier and are unaffected by this toggle.

# absent-key resolution is false, and only an explicit `true` (config) or a

# DENIES any rm target that is neither under the repo / worktree areas nor on a
# built-in ephemeral allowlist (system temp dirs + the Claude scratchpad), in
# addition to the catastrophic top-level deny. A zero-config install therefore
# gets outside-repo rm protection out of the box (e.g. `rm -rf
# /Users/someone/important` is DENIED).
#
# The legacy permissive behaviour — block only catastrophic rm targets (root,
# $HOME, bare top-level dirs) and ALLOW every deeper subpath including subpaths
# OUTSIDE the repo — is now an explicit opt-out: guards.rmScope:"off" (or the
# synonym "permissive") / LOOM_RM_SCOPE=off. Consumers who relied on the old
# permissive default must set one of those to restore it.
#
# The catastrophic top-level deny stays unconditional in BOTH modes, so bare

# unambiguously OUTSIDE every repo root this guard tracks (the main
# checkout's REPO_ROOT, its default in-repo worktrees dir, and any
# configured/overridden worktree root)?
#
# Used ONLY to narrow the force-op:detached ask (#320) for the case where a
# force op's branch identity is ambiguous (detached HEAD / unresolved) — a
# bare out-of-tree scratch clone (e.g. under /tmp, the standard workaround for
# a chronically stale local main: clone, point remote at origin, fetch,
# `reset --hard`, discard) can leave the working copy detached before the
# reset lands it on a named ref. A hard reset there cannot touch a protected
# branch of THIS repo regardless of what the scratch clone's HEAD resolves
# to, so asking buys no safety and stalls headless/autonomous runs with no
# human to answer.
#
# Deliberately conservative: any directory this function cannot cleanly
# resolve (empty, unreadable, or no known REPO_ROOT to compare against) is
# NOT "outside" — the caller keeps asking exactly as before. This is a
# precision fix, not a policy relaxation: a CWD inside the main checkout or a
# managed worktree, or one this guard cannot classify, must keep asking.
#
# REPO_ROOT SELF-MATCH — INVESTIGATED, NOT CHANGED (#350): REPO_ROOT (resolved
# once, near the top of this file) is `git -C "$CWD" rev-parse --show-toplevel`
# — derived from the SAME $CWD a force op's own cwd can equal directly (no
# `-C`/`cd` offset — e.g. a separate Bash call issued after an earlier
# `cd /tmp/scratch`, so this call's own $CWD already IS the scratch clone).
# When that happens, REPO_ROOT trivially resolves to the scratch clone's OWN
# root, so the plain `"$abs" in "$REPO_ROOT"|"$REPO_ROOT"/*` test below
# self-matches and this function returns "not outside" (still asks) rather
# than exempting — the #320/#330 exemption does not fire for THIS shape of
# the idiom (only for the #350-fixed `cd DIR && git …` single-command shape,
# where -C/cd threading gives `_fcwd` a value genuinely different from
# REPO_ROOT).
#
# This is a DELIBERATE gap, not an oversight: with $CWD as the only signal
# available to a single, stateless hook invocation, "the operator's real main
# checkout, given directly as cwd" and "an out-of-tree scratch clone, given
# directly as cwd" are PROVABLY INDISTINGUISHABLE by path comparison against a
# REPO_ROOT derived from that very same $CWD — both self-match identically,
# both can carry a `guards.forceScope:"protected"` config (a scratch clone of
# THIS repo inherits the tracked `.loom/config.json` verbatim), and both can
# resolve to a real or detached branch. A path-shape heuristic (e.g. "abs sits
# under /tmp") was prototyped and rejected: this file's own test fixtures
# (`make_sql_repo`, via `mktemp -d`) — including the #320/#330 controls that
# assert a self-matching cwd inside the "main checkout" still asks — ALSO live
# under /tmp, so any such heuristic exempts exactly the case those controls
# exist to pin. Soundly resolving this would need a $CWD-independent anchor
# for "the repo this guard installation protects" (e.g. a session-scoped
# project-root env var), which this file — a generic, portable guard installed
# across many unrelated repos — deliberately does not depend on; Loom's own
# dispatcher glue (`.loom/hooks/guard-destructive.sh`) already threads an
# analogous `LOOM_PROJECT_ROOT` for a DIFFERENT purpose (choosing which guard
# to exec) and could in principle export it further, but that is Loom-specific
# scope, not this file's. Fail-closed (keep asking) is preserved rather than

#                           ops on the agent's own working branches.

# BACKSLASH-ESCAPE HELPERS (shared by BOTH lexers)
#
# The character at position i is BACKSLASH-ESCAPED when it is preceded by an ODD
# number of backslashes (`\x` is an escape; `\\x` is a literal backslash followed
# by an unescaped `x`). Call sites depend on this parity:
#   - a NEWLINE: an escaped newline is a LINE CONTINUATION — the shell removes it
#     and the logical line continues, so pending heredoc BODIES must not start
#     there;
#   - the leading `<` of a `<<`: an escaped `\<` is a literal `<` inside a word,
#     NOT a redirection operator, so `\<<WORD` never opens a heredoc and must not
#     be probed as one (#108);
#   - a QUOTE character: `\"` is literal text, so it never OPENS a quoted span
#     and is never accepted as the authoritative CLOSE of an active one (#113).
#
# `trusted_close()` resolves that last case for the ACTIVE-span bookkeeping the
# two lexers share. Starting from the naive "next quote of the same kind" index
# it:
#   - SKIPS backslash-escaped quotes (`\"` is literal text, never a real close);
#   - returns 0 — meaning "do not record a close, walk the span the legacy way" —
#     when no unescaped candidate exists, or when the candidate directly follows
#     a backslash run (`\\"`). There the escaped BACKSLASH makes the pairing
#     genuinely ambiguous (the quote is real, but the shell re-parses quoting
#     inside `$( )`), and recording it would end the span at a position the
#     legacy walk pairs differently — the one direction that can lose a segment
#     boundary. Returning 0 reproduces the pre-#113 walk for that span exactly.
#   - for a DOUBLE-quoted span (`qc == dqc`), also SKIPS a same-kind quote that
#     sits at a DEEPER `$( )`/backtick substitution nesting depth than the
#     opening quote itself (#453). A `"` nested one substitution level below the
#     opener belongs to the INNER shell's own quoting, not to this span — it is
#     unescaped, so the pre-#453 walk accepted it as this span's close anyway
#     (a "phantom close"), which handed everything from there to the REAL close
#     — genuinely live code the outer `$( )` is still running — to the inert
#     verbatim-copy branch instead of to the active, separator-tracking one. See
#     subst_depth() below for how the per-byte depth is computed, and the #453
#     block in the ml_segment() copy of this guard for the worked repro. Scoped
#     to DOUBLE quotes only: a single-quoted span's close is *always* the very
#     next single-quote byte in real bash — single quotes cannot nest and admit
#     no expansion of any kind, so a `$(` appearing between them is inert LITERAL
#     text with no bearing on where the span ends, and depth-filtering it would
#     wrongly skip the correct (and only) close.
# Every use of THESE HELPERS is narrowing: treating something as
# escaped/ambiguous/depth-mismatched only falls back to (or stays in)
# separator-ACTIVE segmentation. That is a property of the helpers, not an
# unconditional property of the lexers — see the KNOWN LIMIT note on the
# inert-span branch (#130) for the one shape where correcting the active-span
# pairing lets a STRAY unmatched quote pair differently than it did before #113.
#
# Lives in its own awk source string, prepended to BOTH lexer sources, so
# qsplit() and ml_segment() share ONE definition and cannot drift (#113).
# subst_depth() (the `$( )`/backtick nesting-depth precompute trusted_close()
# needs for the DOUBLE-quote check above) lives here too, for the same reason —
# #453 needed it available to ml_segment(), which qsplit()-only placement
# (its pre-#453 home) did not provide.

# A plain `(` only nests when a substitution is already open: a genuine TOP-LEVEL

#
# The three segment parsers below (parse_force_ops, lifecycle_or_cloud_reason,
# extract_rm_targets) split a command string on the shell separators ; | & && ||
# to find each simple command's command word. The historical split was a naive
#   gsub(/&&|\|\||[;|&]/, "\n")
# over the raw string, which has NO lexer — so a `|`-alternation INSIDE a quoted
# argument (e.g. `grep -E "lifecycle|halt|poweroff"`) was split as if it were a
# real pipe, manufacturing a phantom segment whose command word is the bare word
# `halt` and hard-denying a completely read-only command.
#
# `qsplit()` replaces that gsub: it walks the string tracking single-/double-quote
# state and emits a newline for a separator ONLY when it is OUTSIDE a quoted span.
# A quoted span is treated as inert (its separators are preserved as literal
# text) ONLY when it carries no command substitution — no `$(` and no backtick —
# mirroring strip_literal_text()'s #3679 safety floor: a smuggled
# `"$(a|halt)"` keeps its separators ACTIVE so the genuine protection is intact.
# Such an ACTIVE span still records where it really ENDS, so the character walk
# does not mistake its own closing quote for the opener of a new span (#113) —
# without that, a later unrelated quote paired with the re-opened one and every
# real separator between them (a genuine `; <destructive cmd>` after the span)
# was swallowed as bogus inert text.
# The token VALUES are preserved verbatim (unlike a redaction approach), so
# extract_rm_targets still sees the real `rm` targets. Best-effort like
# strip_literal_text(): where a BACKSLASH makes the quote pairing ambiguous both
# lexers resolve it in the one direction that keeps separators ACTIVE, so the
# result can only gain segment boundaries, never lose them (#113):
#   - a backslash-escaped quote (`\"`) never OPENS a span — it is literal text —
#     so it can no longer start a bogus inert run that swallows real separators;
#   - the close index an ACTIVE span records is resolved by trusted_close():
#     escaped candidates are skipped, and an ambiguous one (`\\"`) records
#     nothing at all so that span is walked exactly the legacy way;
#   - an unterminated quote advances ONE character with separators still active
#     (both lexers) instead of swallowing the remainder of the buffer.
# For every command the shell can actually PARSE, none of these widens a deny
# into an allow; the escaped-quote cases in the #113 test block pin the shapes
# that did. For input with an UNBALANCED quote count the guarantee is weaker —
# see the KNOWN LIMIT note on the inert-span branch (#130).
#
# SEPARATORS INSIDE A COMMAND SUBSTITUTION (#436)
# -----------------------------------------------
# "Keep separators ACTIVE inside a substitution-bearing span" used to mean
# "split the OUTER stream at every `;`/`&`/`|` byte in the span", including one
# that sits INSIDE the substitution's own `$( … )`/backtick boundaries. Such a
# byte is inert to the OUTER shell — it is a pipeline separator of the SUBSHELL,
# never a top-level one — so splitting there tore the enclosing token in half.
# The reported harm: a quoted redirect target
# `> "/tmp/out-$(echo $F|tr -d x).json"` reached extract_write_targets() as the
# fragment `"/tmp/out-$(echo $F`, which no longer looks absolute, so the main
# checkout was prepended and an ordinary /tmp scratch write hard-denied with the
# `worktree-write-confinement` (worktree-isolation-bypass) tag.
#
# qsplit() now models both facts at once instead of trading one for the other:
#   1. subst_depth() precomputes, for every byte, how many `$( … )`/backtick
#      substitutions enclose it (plain `( … )` nests only INSIDE one, so a
#      genuine top-level subshell keeps its separators live). A separator only
#      splits the outer stream when that depth is 0, so the enclosing token —
#      a redirect target, an rm target, a `cd` argument — stays intact.
#   2. subst_inner() re-emits the commands those inner separators really do
#      start as their OWN segments, appended after the outer stream. That is
#      exactly the set of post-separator segments the legacy inline split
#      produced (minus the text that trailed the substitution's close, which
#      belongs to the outer segment), so a smuggled `"$(cat f|sh -c …)"` still
#      exposes `sh` to command_has_shell_segment() and a `"$(x|tee <in-repo>)"`
#      still exposes the write target — the #3679/#3755 safety floor is kept,
#      not relaxed. Text BEFORE a substitution's first inner separator is not
#      re-emitted, matching the legacy behaviour exactly (it stayed part of the
#      enclosing segment there too), so this adds no segment the old lexer did
#      not already produce.
# Unbalanced input stays fail-closed by the same mechanism: an UNCLOSED `$(`
# leaves every later byte at depth > 0, but each separator after it still starts
# an inner segment, so a trailing `; <destructive command>` is still segmented
# and still denied.
# This is deliberately scoped to qsplit() (command_has_shell_segment(),
# resolve_stash_cwd(), extract_write_targets()) — ml_segment() below keeps the
# legacy inline split; its consumers are the three command-word parsers, where
# the split costs no token integrity this change needs to restore.
#
# Shared as a single awk source string so the three parsers cannot drift.

# MULTI-LINE QUOTE-AWARE SEGMENTATION (#71)
#
# The three segment parsers (parse_force_ops, lifecycle_or_cloud_reason,
# extract_rm_targets) originally segmented per awk INPUT RECORD with
# `$0 = qsplit($0); split($0, segs, "\n")`. Because awk's default RS="\n" splits
# a multi-line command into separate records BEFORE the pattern block runs,
# qsplit()'s quote-tracking state — scoped to a single call — reset at every
# embedded newline. An interior line of an otherwise-inert multi-line quoted
# DATA literal (echo/printf/--body) was therefore lexed as its own top-level
# segment with no memory that it is still inside an open quote from a prior line,
# so a quoted `git push --force origin main` false-`ask`ed (parse_force_ops) and
# a quoted `halt` false-`deny`ed (lifecycle_or_cloud_reason). PR #69 fixed the
# identical defect in extract_rm_targets() with a whole-buffer slurp-then-segment
# lexer; this shared helper generalizes that lexer so all three parsers segment
# ONCE over the full command and cannot drift (the same rationale the _QSPLIT_AWK
# header gives for sharing qsplit()).
#
# `ml_segment(buf, segs)` fills the caller's `segs[]` out-array (AWK passes arrays
# by reference) with one entry per top-level segment and returns the count. It
# deliberately does NOT reuse qsplit()+split("\n"): qsplit() emits a `\n` for each
# REAL separator while ALSO leaving a literal newline that lived inside an inert
# quoted span untouched, so the two become indistinguishable to a downstream
# `split(s, segs, "\n")`. Segmentation is therefore done inline here, so an inert
# quoted span's embedded newlines never become segment boundaries.
#
# Segmentation contract (identical to qsplit()'s single-line behaviour, now
# correctly carried ACROSS embedded newlines):
#   - Separators `;` `&` (`&&`) `|` (`||`) OUTSIDE any quote split segments.
#   - A raw newline OUTSIDE any quote ALSO splits — so a GENUINE multi-line
#     command still yields a real later-line segment and still denies (safety
#     floor preserved; matches the old per-record behaviour where each input line
#     was its own record).
#   - An INERT quoted span is copied VERBATIM, so its embedded
#     newlines/separators stay literal and never manufacture a phantom segment
#     out of quoted documentation prose (the false positive). A span is inert
#     when it carries no `$(` and no backtick — and a TOP-LEVEL single-quoted
#     span is inert regardless of its content (#443), because bash never expands
#     or substitutes anything between `'...'`. "Top-level" is load-bearing
#     (#450): an apostrophe met while an ACTIVE span is still open is literal
#     text to the shell, not an opener, so its span may hold live code and is
#     NOT treated as inert.
#   - A DOUBLE-quoted span carrying command substitution (`$(` or a backtick)
#     keeps its separators ACTIVE (walked char-by-char, exactly like qsplit()),
#     so a smuggled payload is never hidden behind an opening quote. Its
#     already-computed CLOSING quote index is remembered (#113) so the walk that
#     reaches it recognises the span TERMINATOR instead of re-opening a phantom
#     span there — the mis-read that used to swallow the whole rest of the
#     command (and with it any `; <destructive cmd>` following the span).
#   - An unterminated quote copies the remainder verbatim (best-effort; never
#     widens a deny into an allow).
#
# HEREDOC AWARENESS (#84)
#
# The lexer above tracked quote state only — it had no concept of heredoc syntax
# (`<<WORD`, `<<-WORD`, `<<'WORD'`, `<<"WORD"`). A composite like
#   gh issue create --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
#   shutdown Iq is specified at ...
#   EOF
#   )"
# therefore fell through to the default "a raw newline splits" rule (the outer
# double-quoted span carries `$(`, so by the #3679 safety floor its separators
# stay ACTIVE), and every heredoc BODY line became its own phantom top-level
# segment. lifecycle_or_cloud_reason() then read `toks[1]` of that phantom
# segment and hard-denied on the word `shutdown`; the same phantom segments
# reach parse_force_ops() and extract_rm_targets(). Heredoc body lines are DATA,
# never command boundaries, so:
#   - A heredoc opener seen OUTSIDE any inert quoted span records its terminator
#     word (quotes/backslash stripped) and the `<<-` leading-TAB-strip flag. The
#     REST of the opener line is segmented normally, so `cat <<EOF | grep x`
#     still splits at the pipe.
#   - The newline that ends the opener line closes that segment (it IS a real
#     command boundary), and the body lines through the terminator are then
#     SKIPPED entirely — they are data, so they contribute no segment and no
#     tokens. Normal segmentation resumes on the line after the terminator, so a
#     real command following the terminator still gets its own segment and still
#     denies.
#   - Multiple heredocs on one line (`cmd <<A <<B`) consume body A in full before
#     body B, matching real shell semantics.
#   - An UNTERMINATED heredoc skips the remainder of the buffer — which is
#     exactly what a real shell does with it (the rest of the input IS the body
#     and never executes), and mirrors the unterminated-quote fallback above.
#     Anything BEFORE the opener is still segmented normally.
#   - SAFETY CARVE-OUT: a body attached to a BARE (unquoted) delimiter is still
#     parameter/command-expanded by the shell, so if such a body carries `$(` or
#     a backtick the whole pending-heredoc region reverts to the legacy
#     separator-active treatment — the same #3679 floor the quoted-span branch
#     applies. A quoted/escaped delimiter (`<<'EOF'`, `<<"EOF"`, `<<\EOF`)
#     suppresses expansion, so its body is unconditionally inert.
#   - `<<<` is a here-STRING, not a heredoc, and is deliberately not matched.
#   - A `<<` inside a shell COMMENT (`echo hi # <<EOF`) is not an operator at
#     all, so the opener probe is SUPPRESSED from a word-initial unquoted `#`
#     through the end of that physical line. Without this, the phantom opener's
#     terminator never appears and the unterminated-heredoc rule would skip the
#     rest of the buffer — hiding a real command on the NEXT line from
#     extract_rm_targets(), which parses raw $COMMAND rather than
#     $COMMAND_NO_COMMENT. Only the probe is suppressed (the characters still
#     flow through normal separator handling), because skipping to the newline
#     would in turn hide a trailing `; <cmd>` after a `#` that sits inside a
#     command-substitution-bearing quoted span.
#   - A newline preceded by an ODD number of backslashes is a LINE CONTINUATION,
#     not the end of the logical line, so the pending bodies do NOT start there
#     (`cat <<EOF \` + newline + `&& <cmd>` really does run `<cmd>`). Such a
#     newline falls through to the legacy separator handling, so the continued
#     line is segmented as the real commands it is; the bodies then start at the
#     first NON-continued newline, matching the shell.
#   - A `<<` whose leading `<` is itself preceded by an ODD number of backslashes
#     (`\<<WORD`) is NOT an operator — `\<` is a literal `<` inside a word — so it
#     is not probed at all (#108). Without this the phantom opener's terminator
#     never appeared and the unterminated-heredoc rule skipped the rest of the
#     buffer, hiding every later real command. The ESCAPED-DELIMITER form
#     `<<\WORD` is a different (and legitimate) thing and is unaffected.
# Safety floor unchanged: the raw ALWAYS_BLOCK_PATTERNS catastrophic scan reads
# the command string directly (never through ml_segment), so a `$(...)`-smuggled
# payload inside a heredoc body still denies, and a GENUINE multi-line command
# whose later real line is dangerous still yields a real segment and still denies.

        # above and the three escape-aware branches below. With those in place

            # about — every #443 payload is a top-level single-quoted argument)
            # — but it is not SUFFICIENT on its own (#453): `acn` is decremented
            # from the recorded active-span CLOSE index below, and that index
            # can itself be a PHANTOM close when a quote of the same kind sits
            # nested one `$( )`/backtick level deeper than the span-s real
            # opener (see the #453 block right below trusted_close()-s call at
            # the bottom of this branch). `acn == 0` still correctly rejects
            # every non-top-level S; it is the trusted_close() depth check that
            # keeps `acn` itself accurate. Do not read `acn == 0` in isolation
            # as "guaranteed top level" — it is "top level, GIVEN an accurate
            # acn" — the #453 fix is what makes that given hold.
            #
            # Reached while an ACTIVE span is still open, that S is a PHANTOM
            # quote: inside a double-quoted span bash reads it as ordinary
            # literal text, so the forward scan above pairs it with some
            # unrelated LATER S, and the stretch between them can hold genuinely
            # live, executing code. Copying that stretch verbatim made the lexer

            #
            #   echo "donSt $(true; <recursive-force rm of an out-of-repo path>) wonSt"

# Parse force-op segments out of a command, emitting one TAB-separated
# "<cpath>\t<target>" line per genuine git force-push / hard-reset. Portable awk
# only (mirrors extract_rm_targets / lifecycle_or_cloud_reason segment parsing):
#   - split on ; | & && || and newline, strip a leading sudo wrapper.
#   - only a segment whose command word is `git` is considered.
#   - `git -C <path> ...` sets <cpath>; other pre-subcommand global options are
#     skipped (`-c <k=v>` consumes its argument).
#   - a preceding `cd DIR &&`/`cd DIR;` segment earlier in the SAME compound
#     command threads DIR through as the effective cwd for later force-op
#     segments (#350) — see the cd-tracking block below for the full
#     rationale. An explicit `git -C <path>` on the force-op's OWN segment
#     still wins over a threaded `cd` (matches git's own -C-over-cwd
#     precedence).
#   - push: emitted only when a --force/-f/--force-with-lease flag is present.
#     ONE line is emitted per positional refspec (pos[2], pos[3], …) after the
#     remote — a multi-refspec push like `git push --force origin a b` emits a
#     line for `a` AND `b`, so a protected branch in any refspec position (not
#     just the first) reaches the caller's per-line check (#3674 follow-up).
#     <target> is the destination branch parsed from each refspec —
#       * `<src>:<dst>` form => <dst>
#       * a bare ref        => the ref with a leading `+` stripped
#       * `HEAD`, or no ref => the literal "@HEAD@" (resolve checked-out branch)
#   - reset --hard: always emitted with <target> = "@HEAD@".
# The caller resolves "@HEAD@" to the checked-out branch and applies the mode.
#
# Second positional arg is the hook's own $CWD, used to seed cd-tracking
# (`curcwd`, below) so a force-op segment with no preceding `cd` and no `-C`
# still emits an explicit <cpath> equal to the caller's own cwd — functionally
# identical to the pre-#350 empty-cpath fallback (`_fcwd="$CWD"` at the call
# site), just made explicit so a LATER `cd` in the same command can override it.

# Redact the quoted VALUES of known text-carrying flags (--body, -m/--message,
# --title, --notes, --comment) so a dangerous-looking phrase quoted INSIDE such a
# value no longer trips the raw ALWAYS_BLOCK_PATTERNS substring scan (catastrophic
# tier) or the ASK_PATTERNS scan (ask tier, #3756). Used ONLY to build the
# literal-redacted working copies for those two loops (mirrors the
# COMMAND_NO_COMMENT precedent); every other scan keeps reading the raw command.
# This kills the #3679 false positive where `gh pr comment --body "…git push
# --force origin main…"` / `git commit -m "…"` hard-denied even though nothing
# executes, and (#3756) the analogous ask-tier false ask where an ask-phrase like
# `gh issue close` quoted inside a `--comment`/`--body` value prompted for
# confirmation despite no such command actually being run.
#
# Safety floor preserved two ways:
#   - `-c` is deliberately NOT a text-carrying flag, so `bash -c '<payload>'`
#     is never redacted and its payload stays caught by the raw scan.
#   - a quoted span is redacted ONLY when it carries no command-substitution or
#     backtick opener (`$(` — which also subsumes the arithmetic `$((` — or a
#     backtick). So a smuggling attempt like `git commit -m "$(git push --force
#     origin main)"` is left intact and still hard-denies.
# Each redacted span is replaced by a SAME-LENGTH placeholder so byte offsets of
# the surrounding command are unchanged. Best-effort like COMMAND_NO_COMMENT:
# it does not model backslash-escaped quotes, but since the result feeds only
# the narrowing (never widening) catastrophic scan, the worst case is a raw
# substring surviving — never a catastrophic block being skipped incorrectly.
# =============================================================================
# dequote_inert_spans (repo#197) — remove the quote CHARACTERS around inert
# quoted spans, leaving their contents in place.
#
# Turns `rm -rf "/"` into `rm -rf /` so the literal catastrophic patterns match
# what the shell would actually run. Callers MUST pass a copy that has already
# been through the sink-aware literal-text redaction, so that prose quoted in a
# --body/-m/--title/--notes/--comment value is already blanked and cannot be
# resurrected into an apparent command by dequoting.
#
# A span containing a command substitution is left completely intact, quotes and
# all, so smuggling still reaches the raw scan unchanged.
#
# Unterminated quotes are emitted verbatim: an unbalanced quote is ambiguous,
# and the raw copy is still scanned, so failing to dequote can only ever keep
# the existing verdict, never widen it.
#
# NOTE: the awk program below is SINGLE-QUOTED. An apostrophe anywhere inside
# it, including in a comment, terminates the string and breaks the guard for
# every command in the repo. Keep comments here apostrophe-free.

# HEREDOC-WRAPPED FLAG VALUES (#317)
#
# The `$(`-floor above is exactly right for a general command substitution, but
# it also declines to redact this repo's own pervasive idiom for a multi-line
# comment/commit-message body (this repo's own CLAUDE.md, "Committing changes
# with git" section, prescribes it):
#
#     gh pr comment 315 --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
#     …prose that may QUOTE a dangerous command as an example…
#     EOF
#     )"
#
# Every value built that way necessarily contains `$(`, so before this pass it
# was NEVER redacted — and a dangerous-command example merely quoted inside the
# body (e.g. a Judge documenting a rejected shell-injection payload, or a test
# fixture describing what an `rm -rf /` denial looks like) hard-denied the
# whole command on the catastrophic tier. Reproduced live against:
#   gh pr comment 315 --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
#   fixture asserts rm -rf / is denied
#   EOF
#   )"
#
# mask_flag_cat_heredocs() (below) closes the gap by masking ONLY the BODY of a
# heredoc in this one provably-inert shape, and only when ALL of these hold:
#   1. the opener is the complete tail of its line, immediately preceded by a
#      recognized text-carrying flag, its opening quote, and `$(cat`;
#   2. the heredoc delimiter is QUOTED (single- or double-quoted, `<<-`
#      allowed) — a quoted delimiter is what guarantees the outer shell
#      performs NO expansion on the body, so a `$(…)` sitting IN the body is
#      inert text rather than live code (an UNQUOTED delimiter is rejected
#      outright, so `--body "$(cat <<EOF ... EOF)"` still hard-denies, exactly
#      as before);
#   3. the block is CLOSED in this same buffer (never mask speculatively);
#   4. the very next line after the delimiter line is `)` + that same opening
#      quote — i.e. the substitution ends immediately, with nothing chained
#      after the heredoc inside it;
#   5. the body ITSELF carries no `$(` or backtick on any line. A single-quoted
#      heredoc delimiter genuinely prevents the outer shell from expanding a
#      `$(…)`/backtick that appears IN the body — `cat` only ever sees and
#      echoes it as literal text — so this condition is a deliberately
#      CONSERVATIVE belt-and-suspenders floor, not a correctness requirement:
#      it keeps this masking pass narrowly scoped to bodies that cannot even
#      be misread as carrying a substitution, rather than trusting every
#      caller of this function to reason about heredoc-quoting semantics.
# Condition 4 is what keeps `--body "$(cat <<'EOF' … EOF` <newline> `rm -rf /`
# <newline> `)"` denying: bash ends the heredoc at the delimiter line and then
# genuinely RUNS the following line inside the substitution, so nothing is
# masked there. Condition 1 is what keeps an INTERPRETER-FED heredoc denying —
# a body consumed by `bash <<DELIM`, `sh -s <<DELIM`, or `cat <<DELIM … | sh`
# is live code to the inner shell, and none of those match `<flag> <quote>$(cat`.
# Condition 5 is what keeps `--body "$(cat <<'EOF'` <newline> `$(rm -rf /)`
# <newline> `EOF` <newline> `)"` denying even though the nested `$(rm -rf /)`
# never actually executes (regression test in
# hooks/repo/tests/test-guard-destructive.sh).
#
# KNOWN LIMITATION (deliberate): this recognizes only the literal
# `cat`-consumed shape spelled out above. A semantically equivalent variant —
# `$(command cat <<DELIM …)`, a heredoc opened on a continuation line, or a
# body whose delimiter line is followed by `) "` with a space — is simply not
# recognized and keeps denying exactly as it does today. That is the safe
# direction (a false positive that already exists, never a new bypass), and
# the shape above is the one this repo's own role prompts prescribe.
#
# This is closely related to `.loom/hooks/guard-destructive-generic.sh`'s own
# mask_flag_cat_heredocs() (vendored from upstream Repo Skills rjwalters/repo
# #5216, which independently closed conditions 1-4 of this same gap) — this

# Redact the quoted argument(s) of a non-executing "data sink" command word

# handed to echo/printf no longer trips the raw ALWAYS_BLOCK_PATTERNS scan
# (catastrophic tier) or the ASK_PATTERNS scan (ask tier) (#53). echo/printf
# print their arguments verbatim; they never EXECUTE them, so a quoted argument
# is inert text — exactly like a --body/-m value — yet strip_literal_text()'s
# flag allowlist never covered it. This is the meta false-positive that blocked
# a guard self-test (`echo '{"…":"<dangerous cmd>"}' | guard-destructive.sh`)
# and blocked filing this very issue's heredoc body.
#
# Command-word anchored (mirrors fastpath_builtin_admits() and the segment
# parsers): the quoted args are redacted ONLY for a simple command whose FIRST
# token is exactly `echo` or `printf` (optionally behind a bare `sudo`/`env`
# wrapper). A wrapper that actually EXECUTES its argument — `bash -c '<payload>'`,
# `sh -c`, `eval`, `xargs` — is never a data sink and is never redacted here.
#
# Safety floor, identical to strip_literal_text()/qsplit():
#   - A quoted span is redacted ONLY when it carries no command substitution /
#     backtick opener (`$(` or a backtick), so a smuggled `echo "$(<payload>)"`
#     keeps its payload intact and still hard-denies.
#   - The `echo '<payload>' | sh` shape (data PIPED into a shell that WOULD
#     execute it) is handled by the command_has_shell_segment() gate at the call
#     site, which skips this redaction entirely whenever any pipeline segment's
#     command word is a shell — so the raw scan still sees and blocks the payload.
#
# Single-pass quote-aware lexer. It deliberately does NOT reuse qsplit(), whose
# `\n`-per-separator contract would conflate a real newline inside a multi-line
# quoted span with a shell separator; here a multi-line span is redacted as one
# inert unit (`.` never matches a newline, so each line stays SAME-LENGTH and the
# surrounding byte offsets are preserved). Best-effort like strip_literal_text():
# an unterminated quote copies the remainder verbatim (never redacts), and the
# result feeds only the NARROWING scans, so the worst case is a raw substring
# surviving (a false block) — never a catastrophic block being skipped.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# OPT-IN QUERY SINKS (repo#311) — $2 non-empty enables them
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# `jq`, `grep`/`egrep`/`fgrep`/`rg`, `sed` and `awk` are data sinks in exactly
# the same sense echo/printf are: their pattern/program argument is text they
# MATCH AGAINST or PRINT, never text they execute. A `jq` query over this very
# repo's guard-decision log, or a `grep` for the literal text of a catastrophic
# pattern, was denied purely because the pattern text appeared as the query
# (repo#311). They are behind an opt-in second argument rather than always-on
# because COMMAND_ASK_SCAN feeds two DENY-tier consumers whose SUBJECT is a
# grep/sed command word (the SQL DDL scan and extract_write_targets()'s write
# confinement — see the consumer audit table at _POSITIONAL_MASK_NEVER); only
# the catastrophic working copy, whose sole consumer is the
# ALWAYS_BLOCK_PATTERNS loop, opts in.
#
# Unlike echo/printf — where every argument is data by definition — these
# commands have flags and sub-forms that DO act. A command word is admitted as
# a query sink only after its whole simple command (raw, pre-redaction, read
# with qseg() below) survives a per-command veto:
#
#   sed   — vetoed by `-i`/`--in-place` (edits the file), by a `w`/`W` write
#           command or s///w flag, and by an `e` execute command or s///e flag.
#           What remains is a query-only `sed -n '…p'` / `sed 's/…/…/'`.
#   awk   — vetoed by `system(…)`, by a pipe-to-command (`print | "cmd"`,
#           `|&` coprocess), and by the one-way `"cmd" | getline` exec form.
#           What remains is pure pattern/print program text.
#   rg    — vetoed by `--pre`/`--pre-glob`/`--hostname-bin`, which name an
#           external program ripgrep executes.
#   jq /
#   grep  — no execution surface at all (jq has no shell-out filter; grep has
#           no exec flag), so nothing to veto.
#
# The veto is whole-command, not per-argument: one `system(` anywhere in the
# simple command disqualifies the entire command from sink treatment, so there
# is no argument-position arithmetic to get wrong (a `sed -i` flag or an
# `awk -F ':'` separator can never be mistaken for program text, because a
# vetoed command is not a sink at all and a non-vetoed one has no argument that
# executes). The vetoes are deliberately over-broad — they may decline a
# genuinely inert command — because declining is the SAFE direction: it keeps
# today's behaviour (a false block), never widens a deny into an allow.
#
# The rest of the safety floor is shared verbatim with echo/printf above: spans
# carrying `$(`/backtick are never redacted, redirection targets are never
# redacted, the command_has_shell_segment() gate at the call site skips this
# whole function whenever any segment could feed a shell, and `bash -c`/`sh -c`/
# `eval`/`xargs` are not sinks and never will be.
#
# $1 = command string. $2 = non-empty to enable the query sinks (absent/empty
# keeps the historical echo/printf-only behaviour).
#
# CONTRACT (repo#434): when $2 enables the query sinks, $1 MUST be the RAW
# command, not a copy another masking pass has already redacted. The vetoes
# below are text checks — they can only refuse what they can still SEE — so a
# copy in which strip_literal_text() has already blanked a `--title "… -i …"`
# value hides the very `-i` the sed veto exists to catch, and admits as an inert
# query sink a command the veto was meant to refuse. strip_literal_text()'s
# quoted-value redaction is a global textual regex with no notion of which
# simple command a flag belongs to, so the hidden token need only share a simple
# command with the sink word. The call site therefore runs THIS function first
# and strip_literal_text() second; ordering them that way is safe in both
# directions because neither pass can create text the other keys on (see the
# PASS 2 comment at the call site for the full argument).

# Mask quoted POSITIONAL arguments (no preceding flag name) to a repo-

# to build the ASK-tier working copy (COMMAND_ASK_SCAN) ONLY — see the call
# site below strip_datasink_literals()'s invocation for that copy. This is
# strip_literal_text()'s counterpart for POSITIONAL text: strip_literal_text()
# only recognizes text following a NAMED flag (--body/-m/--title/--notes/
# --comment); it has no effect on a script whose free-text arguments are
# purely positional, e.g. `./scripts/check-duplicate.sh "TITLE"
# "DESCRIPTION"` where DESCRIPTION happens to quote an ask-phrase. Such a
# script never EXECUTES a positional argument — it only reads it as inert
# search/dedup text — so masking a quoted argument immediately following the
# configured command (optionally after short/long flags, e.g. `check-
# duplicate.sh --include-merged-prs "..."`) can never blind ASK_PATTERNS (or
# any other COMMAND_ASK_SCAN consumer) to a REAL invocation: a wrapper that
# WRAPS the phrase and then executes it — `sh -c "git stash pop"`, `bash -c
# '...'`, `eval "..."` — is never in the allowlist and stays fully visible.
#
# DELIBERATELY EXCLUDES grep/egrep/fgrep/rg AND cp/mv/tee/sed — enforced by
# the caller (positional_mask_cmdre()'s _POSITIONAL_MASK_NEVER set above drops
# them even when configured), not by this function, which simply masks
# whatever command-name alternation it is given. The reasons live with the
# caller (see its full COMMAND_ASK_SCAN consumer audit table); in short, this
# scan feeds TWO deny-tier consumers besides the ask-tier ones:
#
#   - the SQL DDL/DML check (SQL_DDL_PATTERN, below), which intentionally
#     scans a `grep '<pattern>' file` invocation's own quoted positional
#     pattern for a literal DDL phrase like "DROP TABLE" and DENIES, by
#     design — masking grep's own quoted argument here would blind that scan
#     to text it is specifically meant to catch. Adding grep/rg to the
#     allowlist was tried and directly regresses the "Fast path security" /
#     SQL-DDL test coverage in hooks/repo/tests/test-guard-destructive.sh.
#   - the #4178 Bash-tool WRITE CONFINEMENT block, which passes this exact
#     scan to extract_write_targets() and DENIES a write landing in the main
#     checkout from a builder worktree. cp/mv/tee/sed are the command words
#     that extractor recognizes as write idioms, and their target PATH is a
#     positional argument — masking it made `cp "/tmp/src.txt"
#     "<main-checkout>/evil.sh"` fall through from deny to ALLOW under
#     `positionalMaskAllowlist: ["cp"]` (#195 review finding).
#
# Extend the exclusion set only for another read-only positional-arg consumer
# with NO competing raw-text consumer elsewhere in this file (mirrors the
# vendored guard's own extend-only convention for this allowlist), and extend

# SYSTEM-LIFECYCLE + CLOUD-CLI DELETE (segment-parsed, command-word anchored)
#
# The system-lifecycle commands (halt/reboot/poweroff/shutdown/init 0/init 6)
# and the az/gcloud cloud-delete CLIs are far too common as ordinary prose,
# identifiers, and flag names to scan as unanchored substrings — and even a
# whitespace-inclusive boundary anchor still fired inside comments and commit
# messages ("...the box will halt", "...after a reboot event"). A pure regex
# tweak cannot separate `sudo halt` (a real command) from `will halt` (prose)
# because both are "<word> halt".
#
# So we segment-parse instead, mirroring extract_rm_targets(): split the command
# on ; | & && || and newline, strip a leading sudo/env wrapper from each segment,
# and deny only when a segment's *command word* (first token) is exactly a
# lifecycle word — or is `az`/`gcloud` with a `delete` subcommand token. This
# distinguishes `sudo halt` (command word = halt) from `will halt` (command word
# = echo/other) and from `--instance-initiated-shutdown-behavior` (not a command
# word at all). The scan runs against COMMAND_NO_COMMENT so a lifecycle/cloud
# word sitting in a trailing comment is already gone. The catastrophic
# ALWAYS_BLOCK scan above still reads the raw string for the symbolic patterns
# (rm -rf /, the fork bomb, curl|sh) that are not prose-prone (#3584).

# rm -rf SCOPE CHECK - Block rm with recursive/force flags on protected paths
#
# Only *actual local* `rm` command words are inspected. `extract_rm_targets`
# splits the command on ; | & && || and, for each simple-command segment whose
# command word is `rm` (optionally sudo-prefixed) — OR a command-word
# *substitution* `$(...)`/backtick in executable position (#72) — AND which
# carries a recursive/force flag, emits the non-flag argument tokens.
# Consequences (#3553):
#   - A token from an earlier command in the same line (e.g. the `host-ip.txt`
#     in `HOST=$(cat host-ip.txt); ssh $HOST rm -rf …`) is never mis-read as an
#     rm target — only tokens of a real `rm` segment are considered.
#   - An `rm` inside a remote payload (`ssh host 'rm -rf /home/ubuntu/foo'`) is
#     NOT treated as a local rm: the wrapper's command word is `ssh`/`scp`, not
#     `rm`, so no local target is emitted and the local scope check is skipped.
#     The ALWAYS_BLOCK catastrophic patterns above still scan the whole string,
#     so a remote or quoted `rm -rf /` still denies.
#   - Only root, the user's $HOME, and *top-level* directories (/tmp, /var, /etc,
#     /usr, /home, /opt, /bin, …) are blocked. A scoped subpath such as
#     `rm -rf /tmp/whatever` or `rm -rf /var/foo` is allowed — the guard stops
#     obliteration of a whole system/root directory, not cleanup of a subpath.

# Worktree-isolation guard toggle — default ON (rjwalters/repo#188, porting
# the BASH-TOOL WRITE CONFINEMENT category below from Loom's vendored
# guard-destructive-generic.sh, itself gated by worktree_isolation_guard_enabled()
# / guards.worktreeIsolation there). Kept as ONE switch so a repo/session that
# already opted out of Edit/Write-tool worktree confinement (a host tool layered
# on top of this guard, e.g. Loom's own guard-worktree-paths.sh) gets the
# identical decision from this guard's Bash-tool confinement below, and the
# documented escape hatch (a human/driver session that must edit the main
# checkout while worktrees exist) keeps working here too.
#
# Resolution order (highest precedence first), mirroring every other guard
# toggle in this file:
#   1. REPO_GUARD_WORKTREE_ISOLATION env var, then legacy
#      LOOM_GUARD_WORKTREE_ISOLATION (0/false/no disables, 1/true/yes forces on)
#   2. guards.worktreeIsolation via guard_cfg() — repo config wins over legacy
#      .loom (default true when absent)
#   3. Default: true (guard on)
#
# Mirrors sql_guard_enabled() / rm_scope_repo_enabled(): cached in
# _WORKTREE_ISOLATION_CACHE, invoked LAZILY — only once the cheap substring
# pre-check on the write-confinement block below has already matched — so the
# jq config read never touches the hot path for the vast majority of Bash calls
# that contain none of the recognized write idioms at all. The config read is
# best-effort: any parse failure falls through to guard-ON and never trips the
# ERR trap. Resolution mechanics shared via guard_toggle_enabled() above.

# mark_expandable_dollars() — rewrite a raw write-target token into its
# "effective path shape" (#4921).
#
# extract_write_targets() is a TOKENIZER, not a shell evaluator: a token is
# emitted with its quote characters copied verbatim (qsplit's contract) and
# with every `$…` reference unexpanded. Before the write-confinement block can
# reason about WHERE a token lands, it needs to know which `$` characters the
# real shell would actually expand — a `$` inside a SINGLE-quoted span, or one
# preceded by a backslash, is literal data (a file really named `$X`), while a
# bare or DOUBLE-quoted `$` is an expansion the guard cannot resolve.
#
# Emits (in the global _MARKED_TOKEN) the token with:
#   - quote characters removed (so `"$A"/x`, `"$A/x"` and `$A/x` all normalize
#     to the same shape and quoting cannot be used to dodge the shape tests),
#   - backslash escapes applied (the backslash dropped, the escaped character
#     kept literal),
#   - every EXPANDABLE `$` replaced by SOH (0x01) — a character no real path
#     produced by this tokenizer contains — while a LITERAL `$` stays a `$`.
#
# A global rather than a subshell echo: this runs per write target and the
# callers are already in a `while read` loop.
#
# Implemented on top of the shared scanner below so the write-confinement
# block has exactly ONE definition of "what the shell would do to these
# quotes" — a second, hand-copied quote parser is precisely how the two
# consumers would drift apart, and a drift in this grammar IS a guard bypass.

#
# extract_write_targets() emits tokens with their quote characters preserved
# VERBATIM (qsplit's contract, #3755) — extract_rm_targets() and
# parse_force_ops() depend on that raw form and MUST keep receiving it
# unchanged, so this is called ONLY from the write-confinement classification
# below, never from qsplit()/extract_write_targets() themselves. Without it a
# quoted absolute path (`'/main/evil'`, `"/main/evil"`) starts with a quote
# character rather than `/`, so the `[[ … == /* ]]` check misclassifies it as
# RELATIVE and cwd-prefixes it into a location the write will never have.
# From a LINKED-WORKTREE cwd — the canonical builder setup — that fabrication
# walks straight back into the acting worktree's own `.loom-managed` sentinel
# and is silently ALLOWED, defeating the #4178 confinement check by simply
# quoting the target (the same masked-allow shape as the unresolved-`$`
# bypass fixed by #4921/#4927, reached here through quoting instead).
#
# Emits (in the global _UNQUOTED_TARGET) the token with quote characters
# removed and backslash escapes applied, and every other character —
# INCLUDING `$` — copied through unchanged: any expandable-`$` shape was
# already judged by the dedicated unresolved-`$` block above, so a file
# genuinely named `$X` or `~` (single-quoted or backslash-escaped) unquotes
# to the literal `$X`/`~` and still resolves as a plain relative path,
# exactly as today (#4382 / #4921 contracts preserved).
#
# Returns 0 when every quote in the token is balanced (the caller may use
# _UNQUOTED_TARGET). Returns 1 on an unterminated quote — the caller MUST
# then fall back to the raw, quote-preserved token, so an unbalanced quote
# can only ever keep today's verdict, never widen a deny into an allow.

# resolve_stash_cwd — the effective cwd a `git stash pop/drop/clear` runs in.
#
# Transplanted from Loom's vendored copy (loom#5173) as part of the repo#188
# parity reconciliation. Mirrors parse_force_ops' cd-tracking: threads a
# `cd <dir> &&` prefix earlier in the SAME compound command through to the
# stash invocation, so `cd <worktree> && git stash pop` — hook session cwd
# still the main repo root, the common worktree shape — resolves scope
# against the cd TARGET rather than the hook's raw session cwd.
#
# Classification uses strip_cd_quoting() so a fully or partially quoted
# absolute argument is not misclassified as relative; curcwd is still built
# from the RAW cd argument (loom#5372), because the caller unquotes a COPY
# before touching the filesystem.
#
# `git -C <path>` threading (repo#194): a `-C`/`-c` run before `stash` is
# resolved the same way `parse_force_ops` already resolves it for force ops,
# so `git -C <main-checkout> stash pop` run from a worktree cwd is caught
# against the -C target rather than the worktree cwd. See the `toks[idx] ==
# "git"` block below.
#
# `--git-dir=`/`--work-tree=` and a leading `GIT_DIR=`/`GIT_WORK_TREE=`
# assignment run (repo#202): two further shapes reach the MAIN checkout's
# stash stack undetected. `git --git-dir=<main>/.git --work-tree=<main> stash
# pop` matches the pre-check but this parser only recognised -C/-c, so it fell
# back to the raw session cwd (the worktree) and the caller saw no reason to
# ask. `GIT_DIR=<main>/.git GIT_WORK_TREE=<main> git stash pop` does not even
# start with `cd`/`git` -- an assignment token precedes it -- so `toks[1] ==
# "git"` above never fired at all. Fixed by (1) skipping a leading run of
# `VAR=val` tokens before classifying a segment, capturing GIT_DIR/
# GIT_WORK_TREE along the way, and (2) recognising --git-dir/--work-tree (both
# `=`-joined and space-separated) in the same loop that already threads -C/-c.
#
# Output contract changed from one line to three (cwd / git-dir override /
# work-tree override) so the caller can resolve --git-dir scope via
# --git-common-dir rather than reusing the -C cd-and-rev-parse path verbatim --
# --git-dir takes a .git directory, not a worktree path, and cd-ing into it
# then asking git to "rev-parse --show-toplevel" is not the same operation git
# itself performs when --git-dir/--work-tree are passed explicitly. The only
# caller of this function is the stash pre-check block below; no other
# consumer or test calls it directly, so widening the contract here is safe.
#
# repo#204 review: -C and --git-dir/GIT_DIR COMPOSE, and git applies -C first
# no matter where it sits in the argument order -- a relative --git-dir /
# GIT_DIR / --work-tree / GIT_WORK_TREE value is interpreted against the
# post--C directory even when the flag precedes -C, and even when it arrives
# as an env prefix. The first cut resolved the env-prefix pair against curcwd
# BEFORE the -C loop ran, pinning it to the pre--C directory. Raw values are
# now recorded during the loop and resolved once, after it, against the final
# process cwd. (The matching caller-side gap -- probing git for the toplevel
# with no -C at all -- is fixed in the pre-check block below.)

# CD-ARGUMENT TILDE / $HOME EXPANSION (#5315)
#
# The three `cd`-tracking blocks below (extract_write_targets, parse_force_ops,
# resolve_stash_cwd) thread a `cd <dir> &&` prefix through the later segments of
# a compound command by joining <dir> onto a tracked `curcwd`. That join is a
# plain string concatenation with NO word expansion — so a `cd ~/GitHub/loom`
# prefix was joined VERBATIM, embedding a literal `~` mid-path
# (`.../loom/~/GitHub/loom/...`) and mis-resolving every later relative write /
# force-op / stash target of that command (the false positive reported in
# #5315). Only a leading `/` (already-absolute) was handled specially; a leading
# `~` or `$HOME` fell through to the plain repo-relative join.
#
# expand_cd_arg() performs the SAME narrow, unambiguous slice of shell word
# expansion the bash-side expand_leading_tilde() (#4382) already applies to
# write TARGETS, but for the cd ARGUMENT and inside awk (which the write-target
# helper runs too late to reach). `home` is the guard process's own $HOME,
# passed in via `-v home=...` exactly like expand_leading_tilde() reads the
# guard's process $HOME — a same-line `HOME=<x> cmd` prefix in the analyzed
# command text can never redefine it. Handled here:
#   ~            -> home
#   ~/rest       -> home "/rest"
#   $HOME        -> home
#   $HOME/rest   -> home "/rest"
# An expanded value starts with `/`, so the caller's existing `~ /^\//` branch
# then treats it as an ABSOLUTE curcwd (correct — `cd ~` replaces the cwd, it is
# not appended to it).
#
# Left DELIBERATELY UNEXPANDED (returned unchanged, so the caller joins it
# repo-relative — the fail-CLOSED direction this file always biases toward, and
# the same convention already used for `cd -` / a bare `cd`):
#   ~user, ~user/rest   awk cannot safely resolve another user's home (no
#                       getent/dscl without a shell-injection surface); leaving
#                       it repo-relative keeps a genuinely-out-of-tree write
#                       classified as in-tree (denied) rather than guessing it
#                       safe. See the #5315 DECISION note at the head of
#                       extract_write_targets() for the ~user/EPHEMERAL rationale.
# Because qsplit() copies a quoted span VERBATIM (including its quote chars) and
# leaves a literal backslash untouched, a token the real shell would NOT expand
# does not start with a bare `~`/`$HOME` here and falls through unchanged —
#   '~/x' / "~/x"  -> starts with a quote char (shell never tilde-expands it)
#   \~/x           -> starts with a backslash (shell never tilde-expands it)
#   foo~/x         -> tilde is not leading (not an expansion position)
# mirroring expand_leading_tilde()'s quoted-tilde treatment exactly. If `home`
# is empty (HOME unset) every case falls through unchanged, matching that
# helper's `[[ -n "$HOME" ]]` guard.
#
# Shared as a single awk source string (like _QSPLIT_AWK) so the three

# strip_cd_quoting() (#5363) — full quote-removal absolute/relative
# CLASSIFICATION helper for a tracked `cd` argument. Used by the three
# `cd`-tracking awk blocks in this file — extract_write_targets() (the
# write-confinement hard-deny path), parse_force_ops(), and
# resolve_stash_cwd() (the latter two feed the ask-gate for
# force-push/reset-hard branch identity and stash-scope cwd resolution,
# wired up in #5372) — NEVER on the RAW cdarg threaded into curcwd itself
# (see each call site's own comment for why).
#
# The #4933/#4941 fix (cdqc/cdlen leading-and-matching-trailing-quote strip)
# only recognizes a FULLY quoted argument ('/abs/path', "/abs/path"): it peels
# one leading quote character and, if the LAST character of the token is the
# SAME quote character, one trailing one. A PARTIALLY quoted absolute
# argument -- the quote closes mid-token, e.g. '<main>'/defaults -- still
# starts with a quote character, so it fails that narrow test and falls
# through unchanged, still starting with a quote rather than `/`, and is
# misclassified as RELATIVE -- the same masked-allow shape as #4933/#4926,
# reached through a partially-quoted `cd` argument instead of a fully-quoted
# or unquoted one (#5363).
#
# strip_cd_quoting() instead walks the ENTIRE token character-by-character,
# stripping every quote character (both single- and double-quoted spans, with
# ordinary shell nesting: a `"` is literal data inside a `'...'` span and vice
# versa) rather than only a leading/trailing pair -- so '<main>'/defaults
# correctly unquotes to <main>/defaults, which DOES start with `/`, and
# classifies as absolute. This mirrors (but, being pure awk, cannot literally
# share code with) the shell layer's _scan_token_quoting() used by
# strip_target_quoting() for the write-TARGET side (#4926) -- that scanner is
# unreachable from here because this decision is made entirely inside awk,
# before the shell layer ever sees a token. Backslash-escapes and `$` are
# deliberately left untouched (out of scope for a leading-`/` classification
# test, and the existing unresolved-`$` detector downstream,
# mark_expandable_dollars()/#4921, still needs the RAW curcwd this function
# never touches).
#
# Returns the token UNCHANGED whenever a quote is left open at end-of-token
# (in_s or in_d still true) -- an unbalanced/unterminated quote can therefore
# only ever KEEP today's classification, never flip a relative-looking token
# into an absolute one it never proved (same fallback contract as

# QUOTE-AWARE REDIRECTION MASKING (#4245)
#
# extract_write_targets() (below) recognizes `>`/`>>` redirection by splitting
# a qsplit()-segmented command on whitespace and pattern-matching each token —
# but that whitespace split is NOT quote-aware, so a `>` that is DATA inside a
# quoted argument (e.g. `gh issue create --body "... env > config > default
# ..."`) can land in its own whitespace-bounded "token" and be misread as a
# real redirection operator, manufacturing a phantom write target and denying
# a command that writes nothing to the filesystem (#4245; same failure class
# as the #3755 qsplit()/#3679 strip_literal_text() quoting fixes above).
#
# mask_gt() walks the string tracking quote state (single-quoted,
# double-quoted, unquoted) and replaces every `>` found INSIDE a quoted span
# with SOH (0x01, a character that can never appear in a shell command and so
# can never itself be mis-split into a phantom target). It otherwise returns
# the input UNCHANGED byte-for-byte (same length, same whitespace positions),
# so a caller can split both the original and the masked string on whitespace
# and get IDENTICAL token boundaries — the masked tokens are used only to
# DECIDE whether a token is a real (unquoted) redirection operator; the
# ORIGINAL tokens are still used to extract the actual target text.
#
# Deliberately does NOT model backslash-escaped quotes -- same simplification
# qsplit() (above) and strip_literal_text() already accept for this file's
# other quote-tracking scans, and for good reason beyond just consistency: the
# input mask_gt() actually receives (COMMAND_ASK_SCAN, see extract_write_targets()
# below) has typically already been through strip_literal_text()'s OWN
# escape-blind redaction, which can shift a quote's effective position (e.g. an
# escaped `\"` inside a redacted --body value loses its backslash, since the
# redaction's own quote-matching stops at the first bare `"` it finds). Layering
# a stricter, escape-AWARE scan on top of that already-escape-blind text would
# only desynchronize the two passes' quote parity -- worse, in the wrong
# direction (masking too little). Matching qsplit()'s exact toggle-on-every-
# quote-char behavior keeps both passes' parity in agreement. Same accepted
# risk direction as qsplit(): pathological unbalanced-quote input could in
# theory shift parity and mis-mask a genuine unquoted `>`, but that is the same
# best-effort risk this file already accepts for `;|&` segmentation -- never a
# NEW risk introduced here. An unterminated quote (no matching close before
# end-of-string) just runs to the end of the string in that quote state --

# QUOTE-AWARE WHITESPACE MASKING (#4934)
#
# extract_write_targets() (below) recognizes each write-idiom argument by
# `split(seg, toks, /[ \t]+/)` — plain whitespace splitting, NOT quote-aware
# (documented as a known limitation at extract_write_targets()'s own header).
# A quoted target containing a literal space, e.g.
#   echo x > '/main/checkout/evil file.sh'
# is therefore split into TWO tokens (`'/main/checkout/evil` and `file.sh'`).
# Only the first fragment is ever used as the write target. That fragment
# starts with a quote character (not `/`), so it is misclassified as a
# RELATIVE path (strip_target_quoting() correctly reports the dangling quote
# as unbalanced and falls back to the raw fragment per #4926's "never widen a
# deny into an allow" contract -- but the fallback fragment itself still gets
# cwd-joined and can land INSIDE the acting worktree, turning what should be
# a main-checkout DENY into an ALLOW (#4934).
#
# mask_ws() is the same masking technique as mask_gt() above (#4245), applied
# to whitespace instead of `>`: it walks the string tracking quote state and
# replaces every space/tab found INSIDE a quoted span with a placeholder
# character that can never appear in real shell text (STX 0x02 for a masked
# space, ETX 0x03 for a masked tab), so `split(seg, toks, /[ \t]+/)` never
# splits inside a quoted span -- a quoted path containing spaces now yields
# exactly ONE token. unmask_ws() reverses the substitution so the token's
# TEXT is unchanged (real spaces/tabs restored) once splitting is done; only
# the whitespace bytes INSIDE quotes are ever touched, so mask_ws() (like
# mask_gt()) returns a byte-for-byte-length-identical string with identical
# non-whitespace content, which is what keeps the `>`-detection pass (mtoks[],
# masked via mask_gt() on top of mask_ws()'s output) in lockstep with the
# target-text pass (toks[], unmasked back to real whitespace): the two are
# always split into the SAME number of tokens at the SAME boundaries, because
# mask_gt() only ever changes `>` bytes, never whitespace-ness.
#
# Deliberately does NOT model backslash-escaped quotes or attempt look-ahead
# for a terminating quote — same simplification qsplit()/mask_gt() already
# accept (see mask_gt()'s comment above for the accepted-risk rationale). An
# unterminated quote just runs to the end of the string in that quote state;
# never crashes, never mis-indexes, and never widens a deny into an allow
# (the SAME fallback direction qsplit()'s own unterminated-quote handling
# already uses, #4926).

# HEREDOC-BODY MASKING (#5000)
#
# extract_write_targets() (below) is fed the RAW, un-redacted value of a
# --body/-m/--title/--notes/--comment flag whenever strip_literal_text()'s own
# `$(`/backtick safety floor (#3679) declines to redact it -- the common
# real-world trigger being a heredoc-wrapped value, `--body "$(cat <<'EOF'
# ... EOF)"`, this repo's OWN recommended idiom (see CLAUDE.md/builder role)
# for any multi-line/special-character body text. A `>` (or `;`, `&`, `|`, or
# a write-idiom command word like `tee`) sitting on a heredoc BODY line is
# inert DATA *to the OUTER shell* -- the outer shell never shell-parses a
# heredoc body for redirection/separator syntax, regardless of whether its
# delimiter is quoted (see KNOWN LIMITATIONS below for two narrow cases where
# that is not the end of the story) -- but qsplit()/mask_gt()/mask_ws() are
# (like awk itself) driven one
# PHYSICAL LINE at a time, with no memory of the `"` opened several lines
# earlier once a later heredoc-body line is reached, so a write-idiom-looking
# byte on such a line was misread as real shell syntax, manufacturing a
# phantom write target and denying a command that writes nothing to the
# filesystem (#5000; same failure family as #4245/#3679, one line-boundary
# narrower).
#
# mask_heredoc_bodies() sidesteps that per-line memory gap entirely rather
# than teaching qsplit()/mask_gt()/mask_ws() cross-line state -- those three
# are SHARED with extract_rm_targets()/parse_force_ops()/
# lifecycle_or_cloud_reason(), out of THIS fix's scope (#5000's own Affected
# Files list names only strip_literal_text() and extract_write_targets()/
# mask_gt()). It walks the WHOLE (possibly multi-line) buffer ONCE, looking
# for a `<<`/`<<-` heredoc opener whose delimiter is a bare or single/double
# -quoted identifier (`EOF`, `'EOF'`, `"EOF"`, ... -- the near-universal
# real-world shape), then replaces every byte of the BODY -- every full line
# strictly between the opener line and the first following line that is
# exactly (barring `<<-`'s permitted leading tabs) the bare delimiter -- with
# a neutral placeholder byte (ETB, 0x17: never meaningful shell syntax, never
# matched by any pattern elsewhere in this file). Real newlines, the opener
# line, and the delimiter line itself are all left untouched, so line counts
# and the surrounding qsplit()/strip_literal_text() `$(`-floor logic are
# unaffected -- ONLY the inert body content disappears.
#
# MASK ONLY A *CLOSED* BLOCK (#5087 -- the fail-open regression this two-pass
# structure exists to prevent). The masking decision is made per candidate
# opener with the closing-delimiter line ALREADY LOCATED: for each candidate
# on a line, a forward scan looks for the terminating bare-delimiter line
# FIRST, and only a block that is genuinely closed inside this buffer has its
# body masked. A candidate whose delimiter line never appears masks NOTHING
# and the scan simply moves on to the next candidate -- because the original
# single-pass form (which flipped a sticky `inbody` flag the instant it saw
# `<<` and only ever cleared it on a delimiter line) silently masked
# EVERYTHING from a FALSE opener to the end of the command whenever no such
# line followed, swallowing any real `>`/`tee`/`cp`/`mv` target after it and
# defeating the write-confinement guard (#4178) outright. Two ordinary,
# heredoc-free command shapes hit that: a quoted string that merely CONTAINS
# `<<TOKEN` (`echo "test <<TOKEN"`), and an arithmetic bitshift
# (`x=$((1 << 3))`) -- both followed by a genuine out-of-worktree write, both
# ALLOWed pre-#5087 where `main` DENIed. Masking is a NARROWING operation, so
# it must never be applied speculatively: when in doubt, mask nothing and let
# the text flow through the pre-#5000 per-line scan.
#
# Opener detection is correspondingly tightened so the commonest false
# openers are rejected before the forward scan even runs: a `<<<` herestring
# is never a heredoc opener, and a BARE (unquoted) delimiter starting with a
# DIGIT is read as an arithmetic shift operand (`1 << 3`), not a delimiter --
# `<<'3'`/`<<"3"` stay recognized, since an explicitly quoted delimiter is
# unambiguous heredoc intent. Every `<<` occurrence on a line is considered
# in turn (not just the first), so one rejected candidate never hides a real
# terminated heredoc later on the same line.
#
# Deliberately narrow / best-effort, consistent with every other quote-
# tracking scan in this file: an exotic delimiter (not a bare identifier, or
# using shell metacharacters) is simply not recognized as a heredoc opener --
# fail-open for THIS masking pass only, never a NEW risk, since the text then
# flows through the pre-#5000 per-line scan exactly as it always has. Never
# denies by itself; only ever narrows what extract_write_targets() can find,
# matching that scanner's own documented fail-open contract (a missed target
# is the accepted safe direction there) -- a real write-idiom byte OUTSIDE
# any recognized heredoc body, even in the SAME multi-line command, is
# completely unaffected and still flows through unchanged.
#
# KNOWN LIMITATIONS (#5117 -- surfaced during Judge re-review of #5085, left
# in place deliberately rather than folded into that fix):
#
#   1. Interpreter-fed heredocs -- CLOSED for heredocs (#5351), broader
#      interpreter-mediated writes still open. "Inert to the outer shell"
#      (above) is NOT the same as "inert, full stop." When the heredoc body IS
#      the script handed to an interpreter -- `bash <<'EOF' ... EOF`,
#      `cat <<'EOF' ... EOF | bash`, `sh -s <<'EOF' ... EOF` -- a write-idiom
#      line inside that body is genuinely live code to the INNER interpreter,
#      even though the outer shell never parses it as redirection/separator
#      syntax. Plain mask_heredoc_bodies() masks it anyway, so a write that
#      `origin/main`'s single-pass scan correctly caught would be missed.
#      ORIGINAL DECISION (#5117): deferred -- extract_write_targets() kept
#      calling plain mask_heredoc_bodies() and masked interpreter-fed bodies,
#      an accepted ask-tier tradeoff (missed ASK, worst case), while #5198
#      introduced mask_heredoc_bodies_selective() for the CATASTROPHIC tier
#      only (masking an interpreter-fed body there flips a DENY to an ALLOW on
#      the #4523/#4601/#4685 data-loss shape -- never acceptable).
#      UPDATED DECISION (#5351): the deferral no longer stands. The catastrophic
#      tier proved the approach, so extract_write_targets() now ALSO calls
#      mask_heredoc_bodies_selective() (see its END block below) -- both tiers
#      share the same interpreter-aware masking. _selective() recognizes an
#      interpreter-fed opener and leaves that block's body VISIBLE to the scan
#      (so a write into the main checkout inside a `bash <<'EOF' ... EOF` body
#      now DENYs from a managed worktree), while still masking every
#      non-interpreter-fed heredoc in the same command -- so the #4914/#5000/
#      #5181 false-positive fixes (an inert `cat`-body / `--body "$(cat <<'EOF'
#      ... EOF)"` sink) stay intact.
#      STILL OPEN (its own follow-up, NOT closed here): the BROADER,
#      heredoc-independent class of interpreter-mediated writes -- `bash -c
#      '... > f'`, `printf ... | bash`, `dd of=f`, `install -m ... f` -- which
#      extract_write_targets(), a command-word-based scanner, still does not
#      cover regardless of heredocs. Closing that (spotting an inner interpreter
#      invocation and recursively re-scanning its script/stdin argument) is a
#      materially larger, separate piece of work than the heredoc masking pass
#      and is deliberately out of scope for #5351.
#
#   2. Crafted false opener whose delimiter later appears. Opener detection
#      (heredoc_delim_at()) runs on a single physical line, before qsplit()
#      -- it cannot know a `<<TOKEN` substring actually sits inside a quoted
#      string on that line (e.g. `echo "test <<EOF" > /etc/passwd`). If a
#      later line in the SAME buffer happens to equal the bare delimiter
#      (`EOF`) for unrelated reasons, PASS 1 finds it and PASS 2 masks every
#      line in between -- even though real bash treats the whole `<<EOF`
#      substring as quoted text (no heredoc at all) and executes the write
#      immediately. `origin/main` denies this; this masking pass ALLOWs it.
#      This is explicitly NOT fixed here: doing so would require teaching
#      heredoc_delim_at() the same quote state qsplit() tracks, and
#      qsplit()/mask_gt()/mask_ws() are SHARED with extract_rm_targets()/
#      parse_force_ops()/lifecycle_or_cloud_reason() -- exactly the
#      cross-function coupling #5000 deliberately avoided by giving
#      mask_heredoc_bodies() its own single, whole-buffer pre-pass instead of
#      threading state through the shared per-line scanners. A structural
#      fix belongs in its own issue, scoped against that coupling risk, not
#      folded in here.

# either the opener command itself (`bash <<EOF`, `sh -s <<EOF`,
# `python3 <<EOF`, `eval <<EOF`, `source <<EOF`, `. <<EOF`) or the opener is
# piped into one on the same line (`cat <<EOF | bash`). Deliberately a
# whole-line, best-effort check (matching the "narrow / best-effort" style
# of heredoc_delim_at() above): the interpreter must be the COMMAND WORD of
# some segment of the line, not an arbitrary substring -- e.g.
# `echo "installs bash" <<EOF` does NOT match, since "bash" there is a bare
# argument, not the command word.
#
# Recognizing the command word robustly (#5205, widened #5226): the
# interpreter word is matched against the path BASENAME of each segment
# command word, after normalizing away the shell decorations that do not
# change what actually executes --
#   * quoting / backslash-escaping of the command word itself
#     (`"bash" <<EOF`, `\bash <<EOF` -- the classic alias-dodge idiom),
#   * a bare `VAR=value` assignment prefix (`LC_ALL=C bash <<EOF`),
#   * a leading wrapper command with its own flags, assignments and
#     numeric/duration operands (env, command, exec, builtin, sudo, doas,
#     nohup, setsid, nice, ionice, stdbuf, timeout, time, xargs, unbuffer).
# So `/bin/bash <<EOF`, `env bash <<EOF`, `LC_ALL=C bash <<EOF`,
# `sudo bash <<EOF`, `cat <<EOF | sudo bash`, `timeout 60 bash <<EOF`,
# `"bash" <<EOF`, `\bash <<EOF` and `/usr/bin/python3 <<EOF` all resolve to
# the same real interpreter and are caught, closing the evasion class where
# those forms slipped past the older first-token-only / unwrapped checks and
# got their live bodies silently masked (i.e. ALLOWed).
#
# FAIL-CLOSED TAIL (#5226): an interpreter allowlist is an unbounded tail --
# there is always one more wrapper. The residual class no allowlist can ever
# enumerate is a command word the guard cannot resolve to a NAME at all:
# `$SHELL <<EOF`, `${INTERP} <<EOF`, `$(which bash) <<EOF`. Those are treated
# as interpreter-fed, so the body stays visible and the catastrophic-tier
# check still sees any live invocation inside it.
#
# Inverting the whole test (mask ONLY for a known-inert SINK allowlist, so
# every unknown opener fails closed) was considered and deliberately
# rejected: the canonical Loom issue-filing idiom is
# `create-issue.sh --title T --body "$(cat <<EOF ... EOF)"`, whose command
# word is an ordinary repo script -- as is every other repo wrapper around a
# forge call. Under a sink allowlist each of those hard-stalls on a
# catastrophic-tier deny the moment the prose it carries quotes the
# anti-pattern, which is precisely the #5181 false positive this masking
# exists to fix (that bug was found when an agent could not file the report
# about it). So the default for a resolvable-but-unknown command word stays
# "mask", and only unresolvable words fail closed.

# extract_write_targets() — Bash-tool write-idiom target extraction (#4178).
#
# Emits one "<cwd>\t<target>" line (TAB-separated, US separator 0x1f — mirrors
# parse_force_ops' SEP convention) per recognized write idiom found in $1:
#   - `>` / `>>` redirection, bare or fd-prefixed (`2>file`), attached
#     (`>file`) or spaced (`> file`). A dup-to-fd form (`>&1`, `2>&1`) is
#     recognized and EXCLUDED — it never writes a file.
#   - `tee <file>...`            — every non-flag argument is a target.
#   - `sed -i ... <script> <file>...` — only when an -i/-i* flag is present;
#     the FIRST non-flag argument is assumed to be the sed script, the rest
#     are file targets. Exactly one non-flag argument is genuinely ambiguous
#     (could be an -f scriptfile with no positional file yet) and is SKIPPED
#     rather than guessed — allow on uncertainty, never deny on uncertainty.
#   - `cp` / `mv ... <dest>`     — the LAST non-flag argument (the common
#     `cp/mv src... dest` shape).
#
# In the three idiom scans above (NOT the `>`/`>>` scan, which has its own
# operator detection), a `<` stdin redirection is recognized and EXCLUDED
# (#5369): neither the operator token (`<`, `0<`, `</path`) nor the file a
# bare `<` reads FROM is a write target. Skipping it fixes both a false DENY
# (phantom `<repo>/<` targets on `tee f < in`) and, for `cp`/`mv` — whose
# destination is the LAST non-flag token — a false ALLOW where a trailing
# `< in` displaced the real destination. See the inline comment at the scan.
#
# $2 seeds the starting cwd. A `cd <path>` segment updates cwd for LATER
# segments of the SAME command (so `cd <worktree> && echo x > f` resolves the
# relative target against the worktree, not the hook's cwd) — global awk
# variable `curcwd`, threaded across the per-line pattern-action block exactly
# like parse_force_ops threads `cpath` via `git -C`.
#
# NOT a full shell parser: like parse_force_ops / extract_rm_targets, splitting
# a segment into tokens starts from plain whitespace splitting. Unlike those
# two, a QUOTED argument containing a literal space is NOT mis-split here: the
# split runs against mask_ws()'s output (#4934), which replaces whitespace
# INSIDE a quoted span with a non-whitespace placeholder before
# `split(seg, toks, /[ \t]+/)` runs, so a quoted path with an embedded space
# (e.g. `echo x > '/main/checkout/evil file.sh'`) yields exactly ONE token —
# unmask_ws() restores the real whitespace bytes in that token afterward. The
# `>`/`>>` redirection scan below is quote-aware in a second, independent way
# (#4245) via mask_gt() — a `>` inside a quoted argument (e.g. `gh issue
# create --body "... env > config > default ..."`) is never treated as a
# redirection operator, regardless of whether the caller's literal-text
# redaction (next paragraph) already removed it. The caller ALSO feeds this
# the ASK-tier working copy (COMMAND_ASK_SCAN — comment-stripped AND
# literal-text-redacted, i.e. --body/-m/--title/--notes/--comment values are
# replaced with same-length placeholder text) as a second, independent
# narrowing so a `>` that merely appears INSIDE such a quoted value (e.g.
# `git commit -m "a > b"`) cannot manufacture a phantom target even in the
# (non-`>`) tee/sed/cp/mv target-extraction paths below. Any remaining false
# positive resolves to, at worst, an extra deny on a target that isn't really
# a write (safe direction) or a missed target (also safe — the fail-open
# contract this file uses everywhere: ambiguity never widens a deny).
#
# The `cd <path>` tracking now tilde/$HOME-expands its argument via
# expand_cd_arg() (#5315, defined with _QSPLIT_AWK above) — see that function's
# header for the exact expansion rules and the quoted/escaped/`~user` fallbacks.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# #5315 DECISION (recorded, NOT implemented in this pass) — two deliberate
# scope calls, documented here so a later reader does not mistake either for an
# oversight:
#
#   1. `~user` / `~user/rest` in a tracked `cd` argument is left UNRESOLVED
#      (joined repo-relative, i.e. classified in-tree / denied) rather than
#      resolved to another account's home. awk cannot look a user's home up via
#      getent/dscl without building a shell command string around an
#      attacker-influenced username token — a command-injection surface this
#      guard must not open. The write-TARGET side (expand_leading_tilde, #4382)
#      can afford that lookup because it runs in bash with the username passed
#      as a non-eval'd argv element; the cd-argument side runs inside awk and
#      cannot. Leaving it repo-relative is the fail-CLOSED direction (a
#      genuinely out-of-tree `cd ~alice && …` write stays denied, never
#      silently allowed), matching this file's `cd -` / bare-`cd` convention.
#      The overwhelmingly-common current-user forms (`~`, `~/rest`, `$HOME`,
#      `$HOME/rest` — the actual #5315 report) ARE expanded.
#
#   2. EPHEMERAL_PATTERNS-class runtime state (the daemon's own gitignored
#      files — `.loom/.daemon.pid` et al., authoritative list in
#      loom-daemon/src/init/post_init.rs) is NOT exempted from Bash write
#      confinement. As of this change no such exemption exists in either
#      guard-destructive-generic.sh or guard-worktree-paths.sh; adding one is
#      net-new policy, and CLAUDE.md documents an "ungated denial floor" that no
#      toggle may bypass, so a gitignore-aware carve-out risks widening that
#      floor into an allow if scoped even slightly too broadly. The concrete
#      #5315 report was a false POSITIVE caused entirely by defect (1) above
#      (the literal-`~` mis-join), which this change fixes directly — an
#      operator maintaining `.loom/.daemon.pid` runs from the primary checkout,
#      not a builder worktree, so once the path resolves correctly it is a
#      routine main-checkout write and the confinement question is orthogonal.
#      Deferred to a dedicated follow-up so the exemption's blast radius can be
#      designed against the denial floor deliberately rather than bolted on
#      alongside a canonicalization fix. See #5315 for the deferral rationale.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# SAME-COMMAND VARIABLE RESOLUTION (#4881): a write-idiom target whose token
# is `$NAME`/`${NAME}[...]` is not itself a real path — the real shell
# substitutes it from that variable's value before the redirect/tee/sed/cp/mv
# ever runs. This tokenizer previously treated such a token as a literal
# relative path and cwd-prefixed it, manufacturing a phantom repo-relative
# target (e.g. `SCRATCH=/private/tmp/.../scratchpad` on one line, then `... >
# $SCRATCH/out.txt` on the next, was denied as a worktree-isolation bypass
# even though the real target resolves to /private/tmp, far outside the
# repo). `resolve_var()` below performs the ONE unambiguous, narrow piece of
# this: when the SAME command text contains a `NAME=value` assignment (no
# embedded whitespace in `value`, optionally single/double-quoted) earlier in
# the stream, later `$NAME`/`${NAME}` leading a write target is substituted
# with that value. Threaded via the awk global `varmap`, exactly like `curcwd`
# above. The assignment scan recognizes every ordinary shell assignment
# position, not just a segment that is exactly one bare `NAME=value`:
#   NAME=value                       (bare)
#   export/readonly/declare/typeset/local [-flags] NAME=value [NAME2=value2]
#   A=1 B=2                          (several assignments in one segment)
#   A=1 some-command args…           (env-var prefix — A recorded, then the
#                                     REST of the segment is still scanned as
#                                     a command for write idioms)
#
# CONFLICTING ASSIGNMENTS ARE UNRESOLVABLE (#4914 review): the scan is not
# control-flow aware — qsplit() flattens `||`/`&&`/`;` into plain segments — so
# a name assigned two DIFFERENT values in one command
# (`A=<repo>/defaults/hooks || A=/tmp/outside`) is poisoned to the unresolvable
# sentinel rather than resolved to whichever branch happens to come last in the
# token stream. See record_assign() below.
#
# FAIL-CLOSED ON UNRESOLVABLE (#4914 review): a `$NAME` with NO matching
# assignment, or a token starting with `$` that is not a bare variable
# reference at all (`$(...)` command substitution, `${VAR:-default}`, `$1`,
# an inherited/sourced env var, …), is UNRESOLVABLE. It is NEVER guessed —
# and it is NEVER skipped either. It falls back to the PRE-#4881 behavior:
# the raw token is treated as a literal (repo-relative) path, so a write that
# lands inside the main checkout still denies with the ordinary
# `worktree-write-confinement` tag. Skipping an unresolvable target would
# hand every un-parsed assignment shape a free #4178 worktree-isolation
# bypass (`export SNEAK=<repo>/defaults/hooks; echo x > $SNEAK/evil.sh`), so
# this fix only ever RELAXES the one literally-resolvable case it can prove
# lands outside the repo — it never flips the default for anything else. (The
# file's broader "ambiguity never widens a deny" contract is about not
# inventing NEW denies; preserving an EXISTING one is the conservative side.)

    # NOT control-flow aware -- qsplit() flattens `||`/`&&`/`;` into plain
    # segments, so `A=<in-repo> || A=/tmp/outside` reaches here as two
    # assignments to the same name. A plain last-write-wins store would then
    # resolve `$A` to whichever branch happens to appear LAST in the token
    # stream, which real bash need never take (`||` short-circuits, so `$A` is
    # the in-repo value at runtime) -- silently ALLOWing a write into the main
    # checkout. So when a name is re-assigned a DIFFERENT value within the same
    # command, its entry is replaced with the AMBIG sentinel instead: a
    # `$`-leading value, which resolve_var() already refuses to substitute as
    # an unresolved chain. The token then falls back to the literal
    # (cwd-prefixed) treatment and denies -- the same fail-closed path every
    # other unresolvable shape takes. Poisoning is sticky (any later assignment
    # differs from the sentinel too) and deliberately blunt: it also covers
    # sequential `A=x; A=y` reassignment, where resolving is *possible* in
    # principle but the safe direction is to stop guessing. Re-assigning the
    # SAME value is not a conflict and still resolves normally -- quotes are
    # stripped above, before the comparison, so a bare and a quoted spelling of
    # one value compare equal.
    #
    # A NON-STATIC RHS POISONS THE VARIABLE TOO (repo#293 review): resolution is
    # only ever sound when the recorded value is a STATIC LITERAL — a value the
    # real shell would hand to the write idiom byte-for-byte, with nothing left
    # for it to expand. Before this check, "static" was enforced only by
    # a test inside resolve_var_core() on the FIRST character, which caught
    # `A=$B/x` and `A=$(pwd)/x` but nothing embedded further in. That left a
    # live fail-open bypass on this catastrophic-tier guard:
    #
    #     V="<worktree>/`echo evil`/x"; cp /tmp/y "$V/pwned.sh"
    #
    # was ALLOWED — the backtick command substitution sits mid-value, so the
    # leading-byte test never saw it, the value was stored as if it were a
    # proven literal, and the downstream #4921 unresolved-`$` backstop found no
    # `$` in the resolved token to trip on (a bare backtick pair carries none).
    # The `$(...)` spelling happened to be caught only incidentally, because its
    # literal `$` survived substitution into the final token. Relying on that
    # accident is not a safety property.
    #
    # So the eligibility bar is now enforced where the value is CAPTURED, not
    # where it is consumed, and over the WHOLE string rather than its first
    # byte: any RHS containing a backtick or a `$` ANYWHERE is poisoned to
    # AMBIG and never becomes a resolvable literal. This is checked against the
    # RAW word (before the outer quote pair is stripped), so no spelling of the
    # quoting can hide an expansion character from it. Deliberately blunt, and
    # deliberately on the conservative side of the "ambiguity never widens a
    # deny" contract this file states elsewhere: poisoning only ever routes the
    # token back to the pre-#4881 literal treatment, which fails CLOSED under
    # `worktree-write-confinement-unresolved-var`. A value containing a `$` the

    # as well — that costs a resolution this guard was never entitled to make,

# expand_leading_tilde() — shell-accurate tilde expansion for write targets
# (#4382, same fix family as the quote-aware `>` scanning of #4245/#4289).
#
# extract_write_targets() (below) is a plain-whitespace/quote-aware TOKENIZER,
# not a shell evaluator — it never performs word expansions (tilde, variable,
# glob, ...). A raw token like `~/.local/bin/x` was therefore resolved as a
# REPO-RELATIVE path (cwd-prefixed) even though the real shell would expand it
# to "$HOME/.local/bin/x" before `cp`/`mv`/`tee`/`sed -i`/redirection ever see
# it — producing a false-positive worktree-confinement deny on a write that
# actually lands far outside the repo (#4382).
#
# This performs ONLY the narrow, unambiguous piece of shell word-expansion
# tilde-expansion applies to: an UNQUOTED, UNESCAPED tilde as the FIRST
# character of the token, i.e. exactly the shell-eligible positions:
#   ~/rest        -> "$HOME/rest"
#   ~             -> "$HOME"
#   ~user/rest    -> "<user's home>/rest"   (only if that user resolves)
#   ~user         -> "<user's home>"
#
# Because qsplit() (the shared tokenizer, #3755) copies a quoted span
# VERBATIM including its quote characters, and leaves a literal backslash
# untouched, a token whose raw text does not start with a bare `~` was NOT
# eligible for shell tilde-expansion and MUST stay untouched here:
#   '~/x'   -> starts with a quote char, shell never expands it (stays literal)
#   \~/x    -> starts with a literal backslash, shell never expands it either
#   foo~/x  -> tilde is not the leading character -- not an expansion position
# Any of these three cases falls through unchanged (echoed back as-is), which
# preserves the existing (correct) repo-relative/deny behavior for them.
#
# `~user` lookup uses getent (Linux) / dscl (macOS) with the username passed
# as a plain CLI argument (never eval'd/interpolated into a shell string) so a
# hostile username token cannot inject a command. If the user cannot be
# resolved on this host, the token is returned UNCHANGED (falls back to the
# existing repo-relative treatment) -- consistent with this file's fail-open
# contract: uncertainty here biases toward the (safe) deny path, never toward
# a silent new allow.

        #   (1) the variable IS the path root — nothing literal precedes the

        #       relative, so it is ALWAYS denied when rmScope=repo — exactly
        #       write confinement's own root-unresolved case.
        #   (2) the variable is in a LATER directory component, with a real
        #       literal path root before it (`build/$sub/out`,
        #       `./cache/$name/tmp`). The root here IS known (literal, or
        #       cwd when relative), so the KNOWN prefix — everything before
        #       the first unexpanded `$`, trimmed to its directory — is
        #       scope-tested on its own via _rm_scope_in_scope(): in scope ->
        #       ALLOW (the rm stays inside the area rmScope=repo already
        #       permits), not in scope / unusable -> DENY. This is the
        #       OPPOSITE polarity from write confinement's equivalent case
        #       (which denies an in-scope known prefix, because there the
        #       risk is an escaping WRITE); here the risk is a DELETE landing

# BASH-TOOL WRITE CONFINEMENT — worktree isolation for `>`/`>>`/tee/sed -i/
# cp/mv (issue #4178)
#
# guard-worktree-paths.sh confines Edit/Write tool calls to a builder's issue
# worktree, but the Bash tool has no equivalent confinement — a session denied
# on Edit/Write could fall back to a Bash write and land the same edit in the
# main checkout (the #4178 incident: sweep #4063 escaped this way and edited
# live guard hooks in the main checkout while its own worktree stayed clean).
#
# Gated by the SAME toggle as guard-worktree-paths.sh
# (guards.worktreeIsolation / LOOM_GUARD_WORKTREE_ISOLATION,
# worktree_isolation_guard_enabled() above) and only denies when a managed
# worktree actually exists somewhere for this repo — exactly the
# path_derived_allow() logic in guard-worktree-paths.sh, reimplemented here
# because this is a separate Bash-matcher hook with its own fail-open
# contract. A cheap substring pre-check keeps the segmenter off the hot path
# for the vast majority of Bash calls that contain none of the recognized
# write idioms at all.
#
# `<<` is ALSO in this pre-check (#331): a structured-interpreter (python/
# perl/ruby/node) heredoc body containing a write-mode marker but none of the
# literal shell bytes above -- `open(f, "w")`, `os.remove(...)`,
# `shutil.rmtree(...)` -- must still reach extract_write_targets() for its
# structured_body_has_write_marker() carve-out (see mask_heredoc_bodies_selective()
# above) to have a chance to convert that marker into the synthetic `> .`
# write idiom it deliberately injects. Without `<<` here, such a command never
# even reaches the segmenter and the write-mode marker is never seen -- a
# silent hole in the #331 safety floor ("a write-mode payload must still
# deny"), not merely a missed optimization. Heredocs are rare enough in
# practice that this stays a cheap, narrow widening of the pre-check, not a
# reintroduction of the hot-path cost this comment describes avoiding.

        #       prefix is pure invention. Denied regardless of where cwd is.
        #   (2) an expandable `$` appears in a DIRECTORY component of the
        #       resolved path (`> $A/evil`, `> ./$A/evil`, `cd $A && > f`)
        #       AND the known prefix — everything before the first `$`, i.e.

        #       guard protects, or there is no usable known prefix at all
        #       (it is relative, or it normalizes to `/` as in
        #       `> /tmp/../$A/evil`). An unknown directory component under the

        #       test can see it.
        #
        # Deliberately NOT denied (no new false positives — these keep their
        # existing treatment):
        #   - a `$` only in the FINAL component (`> out-$STAMP.log`,
        #     `sed -i s/a/b/ src/$f`): the directory is fully known and really
        #     is cwd-relative, so the sentinel check (a) and the main-root
        #     containment test below are meaningful again.
        #   - a known prefix OUTSIDE the protected area (`> /tmp/$D/f.log`):
        #     the write lands where this guard protects nothing.

# GIT STASH SCOPE ASK — gated by the stash-scope guard toggle
#
# Transplanted from Loom's vendored copy (loom#5173/#4821/#5217) as part of the
# repo#188 parity reconciliation. Before this, the canonical guard had ZERO
# coverage of `git stash` — an agent could destroy operator-preserved WIP with
# no confirmation, while the vendored guard asked. That was the single largest
# capability gap between the two.
#
# Two distinct hazards, both real:
#
# 1. MAIN CHECKOUT. The main checkout's stash stack is operator-owned, not
#    scratch space for an integration check. `pop`/`drop`/`clear` there can
#    destroy state a human deliberately preserved.
#
# 2. WORKTREE-TO-WORKTREE COLLISION. `refs/stash` is a SINGLE stack shared by
#    every linked worktree of a repo, not per-worktree. Two agents working in
#    different worktrees can pop or drop each other's WIP, and a main-checkout-
#    only check asks for neither side. A single active worktree has nobody to
#    collide with, so it stays ungated.
#
#    GENERALIZED from Loom's version, which counted `.loom-managed` marker
#    files under `<main>/.loom/worktrees/`. This counts what git itself
#    reports, so the hazard is caught for any tool's worktrees — or none at
#    all — rather than only Loom's. Same reasoning as the tool-agnostic
#    worktree-root detection elsewhere in this file.
#
# A same-chain heuristic ("push and pop appear in the same command, so allow")
# was considered and rejected upstream (loom#5217): push and pop are separate
# guard-approved calls with arbitrary time between them, so another worktree's
# concurrent push can land on the shared stack in that window and the paired
# pop then restores the WRONG entry. A same-chain check cannot see that.
#
# Gated by stash_scope_guard_enabled() (guards.stashScope /
# REPO_GUARD_STASH_SCOPE, legacy LOOM_GUARD_STASH_SCOPE, default on), invoked
# LAZILY only after the pattern matched, mirroring every other cold-path toggle.
# =============================================================================
# The optional `(-C <path>|-c <k=v>)*` run between `git` and `stash` is
# repo#194: without it this pre-check never matches `git -C <path> stash pop`,
# so the parser below never runs and the -C form escapes the ask entirely —
# the pre-check, not the parser, is the actual gate.
#
# The flag value must tolerate whitespace inside quotes, and MIXED forms like
# `-c user.name="John Doe"` where one token is part bare and part quoted. A
# first cut used `[^[:space:]]+`, which silently reintroduced the very bypass
# this closes: any quoted value containing a space failed the positional match,
# so the whole pre-check missed and the ask was skipped — a silent allow, not
# even an ask. Rather than enumerate token shapes, match the flag run
# non-greedily up to `stash`, and let the parser below (which is genuinely
# quote-aware via qsplit/mask_ws) decide scope. This gate only needs to be
# permissive enough not to miss; being over-inclusive here costs a parser call,
# never a wrong verdict.
#
# repo#202: a leading `GIT_DIR=<path> GIT_WORK_TREE=<path>` assignment run
# before `git` is a DIFFERENT parse shape — the command does not start with
# `git` at all — so it needed its own alternative in this same pre-check
# rather than a tweak to the existing one. `([A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*=[^;&|[:space:]]*[[:space:]]+)*`
# tolerates zero or more such assignments (any name, not just GIT_DIR/
# GIT_WORK_TREE — resolve_stash_cwd only ACTS on the two it recognises, so
# being permissive here again only costs a parser call, never a wrong verdict).
