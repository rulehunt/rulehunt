#!/usr/bin/env bash
# repo-remote.sh — headless, scriptable entry point for /repo:remote provisioning.
#
# This is the non-interactive implementation of the provisioning contract
# documented (as prose) in commands/repo/remote.md. The interactive skill wraps
# this script with its wizard / cost-confirmation UX and, once the human has
# confirmed, calls `repo-remote up --yes`; a caller such as loom's
# `fleet add-worker` invokes the same `up --yes --json` path directly. There is
# ONE implementation of the contract so the two paths cannot drift (repo#52).
#
# The seam this produces, consumed by loom fleet orchestration: "a reachable
# Ubuntu box, this repo's SSH alias written, instance id recorded" — emitted as
# machine-readable JSON (instance id, public IP, SSH alias, estimated hourly
# cost) so a caller can implement loom's "plan shown before money is spent" rule.
#
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# STABLE INTERFACE (downstream tooling gates on this via the package version)
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Subcommands (both the `up`/`down`/`status` verbs and the remote.md-style
# `--status`/`--down` flags are accepted, for parity with the prose command):
#
#   repo-remote up [--yes] [--force] [--json] [aws|gcp]   Provision (or reuse)
#       an instance.
#       Without --yes: a DRY-RUN plan (resolved spec + estimated cost) is emitted
#       and NOTHING is created — this is the "plan shown before money spent" path.
#       With --yes: the plan is executed. --yes removes the *prompt*, never the
#       *consent requirement*: a cost-relevant field missing from config is a
#       loud, non-zero-exit failure, never a silent default (repo#52 cost gate).
#       --force overrides the fleet-marker guard described below. It does NOT
#       relax the cost gate.
#
#   repo-remote status|--status [--json] [aws|gcp]   List instances this command
#       created (tagged repo-remote=<name>) with state; no mutation.
#
#   repo-remote verify|--verify [--json] [aws|gcp]   Prove the SSH alias still
#       reaches THIS repo's instance before anything is trusted to it. Opens one
#       SSH session over repo-remote-<name>, asks the host for its OWN instance
#       id, and compares it with the id this repo expects (a pinned
#       REPO_REMOTE_INSTANCE_ID, else the repo-remote=<name> tag). Exits 6 on a
#       mismatch AND on any answer it cannot establish (unreachable host, no
#       identity source) — it fails CLOSED, because "I could not tell" is not
#       evidence that the host is the right one. See "Host-identity
#       verification" below. No cloud mutation; no cloud call at all when the
#       instance id is pinned.
#
#   repo-remote down|--down [--yes] [--force] [--json] [aws|gcp]   Teardown.
#       Without --yes: a DRY-RUN listing of exactly what would stop/terminate
#       (fleet-marked instances, if any, are annotated but never block a dry
#       run — see the fleet-marker guard below).
#       With --yes: stop them; add --delete to terminate (disk goes with it).
#       --force overrides the fleet-marker guard described below, same as `up`.
#
# Config: two layers, shared first then repo (repo overrides), matching the
# skill exactly:
#   1. ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/repo/remote.env   (shared cloud creds)
#   2. <git-root>/.env                                     (per-repo machine)
#
# Cost gate (repo#52 — the highest-cost-of-being-wrong element): `up` (with or
# without --yes) REQUIRES the provider, that provider's credentials, and
# REPO_REMOTE_INSTANCE_TYPE to be present in config. Instance type is the
# cost-relevant field and is NEVER defaulted here — that removes interactivity,
# not consent. Non-cost-relevant fields (disk, idle window, image) do fall back
# to built-in defaults, matching the prose command.
#
# Fleet-marker guard (repo#164, repo#170): both `up` and `down` resolve an
# instance from the SAME two never-expiring handles — a pinned
# REPO_REMOTE_INSTANCE_ID, or one carrying the repo-remote=<name> tag/label
# (`down`'s tag-discovery path can resolve more than one). That resolution is
# stale-tag-prone: a host provisioned once for an ephemeral dev session can
# later become a persistent fleet worker while still carrying the repo-remote
# tag, at which point this ephemeral tooling would happily reuse it
# (operator incident, private tracker). `down` is the strictly worse case: it STOPS the resolved
# instance, or — with --delete — TERMINATES it, disk and all, unrecoverable.
# So before `up` starts/aliases a REUSED instance, or `down` stops/terminates
# any resolved instance, its tags (AWS) / labels (GCP) are checked for a fleet
# marker — by default Fleet=loom, configurable via REPO_REMOTE_FLEET_TAG_KEY /
# REPO_REMOTE_FLEET_TAG_VALUE. If present, the run STOPS (exit 5) with a clear
# message unless --force is given; with --force it proceeds after a loud
# warning. `down` refuses the WHOLE resolved batch if ANY id in it carries the
# marker, rather than silently acting on a subset. Setting
# REPO_REMOTE_FLEET_TAG_KEY= (empty) disables the check entirely. The guard
# never applies to a freshly created instance (nothing to inherit) and never to
# a dry run (which touches no cloud resource at all) — a `down` dry run
# annotates any fleet-marked instances in its listing instead of blocking.
#
# Host-identity verification (repo#458): an EC2 auto-assigned public IPv4 is
# RELEASED when the instance stops and a different one is assigned on its next
# start — and the released address is handed to whoever starts an instance next,
# very possibly another AWS customer entirely. The SSH alias this script writes
# is therefore only as fresh as the last `up` (or `verify`) run: nothing keeps it
# current between sessions. In the incident behind this check, a stopped/started
# box's old address came back up on a stranger's instance, the unchanged alias
# resolved, ssh connected, key auth succeeded, and three agents wrote work
# products to a machine that was not theirs. Every signal the tooling had said
# "fine".
#
# So `up` (after it writes the alias) and the standalone `verify` subcommand both
# ask the reached host for its OWN instance id and compare it against the id this
# repo expects. The id is read, in order, from: the marker file this tool drops at
# provision time (REPO_REMOTE_HOST_ID_FILE, default /etc/repo-remote-instance-id),
# the instance metadata service (IMDSv2, then IMDSv1, then GCP's), and finally
# cloud-init's /var/lib/cloud/data/instance-id — so an instance provisioned before
# the marker existed is still verifiable. A MISMATCH always exits 6, in both
# paths; --force does NOT override it (that flag is the fleet-marker override and
# nothing else). The two paths differ only on an answer that could not be
# established at all:
#   verify  — exits 6. Fails CLOSED: it exists precisely to be run before an
#             agent trusts a session it did not just create.
#   up      — warns loudly and continues. `up` resolved the IP from the cloud API
#             and rewrote the alias in the SAME run, so the alias is fresh by
#             construction there; failing the run on an IMDS-locked-down or
#             pre-marker box would break provisioning for no safety gain.
# Pinning REPO_REMOTE_INSTANCE_ID is the recommended configuration for any
# session expected to survive a stop/start: it makes the expectation explicit
# rather than re-derived from a tag that a fleet host can also be wearing.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  success (including a dry-run plan)
#   2  missing / invalid required config (the cost gate; loud failure)
#   3  provider authentication failed
#   4  cloud operation failed
#   5  refused to act (reuse via `up`, stop/terminate via `down`) on a
#      fleet-marked instance (pass --force to override)

# ── the fleet-marker guard (reuse discovery, repo#164) ──────────────────────
# `up` never re-attaches user-data to an instance it reuses — the guard a host
# carries is whatever it got at its one-time creation. What reuse DOES do is
# start a stopped instance and rewrite this repo's SSH alias to point at it. The
# instance it reaches is resolved from a pinned REPO_REMOTE_INSTANCE_ID or from
# the repo-remote=<name> tag/label, and neither of those handles expires: a box
# provisioned once as an ephemeral dev session can since have become a
# persistent, daemon-managed fleet worker while still carrying the old tag. That
# is exactly how `repo-remote=anvil` tooling kept rediscovering a fleet host
# after it became a fleet host (operator incident, private tracker).
#
# So: before a REUSED instance is started or aliased, look for a fleet marker
# the fleet-management side already had to set deliberately elsewhere. This is a
# provisioning-time check against declared metadata — deliberately NOT an
# on-host "is some process running" heuristic, which repo#79 rejected for the
# guard's runtime logic and which nothing here reopens.

# True when a discovered marker value counts as "this is a fleet host".
# Compared case-insensitively: GCP lower-cases label values, AWS tags don't.

# ── the idle-shutdown guard (cloud-init user-data) ──────────────────────────
# A forgotten VM — GPU ones especially — must turn itself off. Emitted as a
# cloud-init script that installs a cron watchdog running `shutdown -h` after
# IDLE_MIN minutes with no active SSH session and low CPU.
#
# "Activity" is defined by exactly two local signals: an open SSH session (`who`)
# OR CPU load average > 0.2. There is NO process-name veto — a running daemon
# (loom-daemon or otherwise) does NOT, by itself, keep this host alive. If a
# future daemon-presence veto is ever wanted it must be added deliberately here
# and documented; it is not implied by the current logic.
#
# BACKGROUND JOBS DO NOT HOLD THIS GUARD (repo#451). A job started over a single
# non-interactive SSH command — `ssh <alias> 'nohup make -j8 &'` and friends —
# stops counting as activity via `who` the MOMENT that ssh command returns: the
# login shell that ran it has already exited, so there is no session left for
# `who` to report. From then on the job is protected ONLY by its own CPU usage
# keeping the load average above 0.2, and there is no process-name veto to fall
# back on. A long build with I/O-bound or license-wait lulls can dip under that
# threshold for a full IDLE_MIN window and be powered off mid-run (the reported
# incident: a ~20-minute nohup'd build killed by a 120-minute window's guard).
# For work that may go CPU-idle, either hold a real session for its duration
# (`tmux`/`screen` on the host, or an interactive SSH session left open) or size
# REPO_REMOTE_IDLE_SHUTDOWN_MIN to the job.
#
# Idle-exit marker contract (published by this repo so a daemon side can conform
# without this repo depending on it): when $IDLE_MARKER exists on-host, the guard
# treats its mtime as an authoritative "idle since" timestamp and shuts down
# IDLE_MIN minutes after that mtime — REPLACING (not supplementing) its own
# $STAMP-based countdown start for that pass. A daemon that idle-exits cleanly can
# `touch` this file to hand the guard a precise idle-start instead of waiting for
# the guard's own load-average sampling to first read idle. The guard works
# standalone: with no marker file present it falls back to the unchanged
# who/load/$STAMP behavior. The marker path is always embedded (default below,
# overridable via REPO_REMOTE_IDLE_MARKER) so the branch is inert-but-ready.
#
# IDLE_MIN <= 0 means "guard disabled" (repo#163) — the opt-out an operator
# reaches for via REPO_REMOTE_IDLE_SHUTDOWN_MIN=0, e.g. for a fleet-tagged host
# that should never self-shutdown. This must NOT be handled by feeding 0 into
# the generated script's `(NOW - LAST) / 60 -ge IDLE_MIN` arithmetic — that
# makes the guard fire almost immediately (0 >= 0 is true on the very first
# post-$STAMP tick) instead of never. So the window is validated here, before
# any guard/cron script is emitted at all: a non-positive (or non-numeric)
# IDLE_MIN short-circuits to no output, and callers (aws_create, gcp_up) must
# check idle_guard_enabled too so they skip embedding user-data entirely.

# aws_wait_public_ip: poll aws_public_ip() with a BOUNDED retry budget, echoing

#
# Why a poll at all: a stop/start cycle (the idle guard stops the box; the next
# `up` starts it again) assigns a BRAND NEW public IP, and AWS does not always
# have it attached by the time `wait instance-running` returns. The single
# unretried query this replaces could therefore observe "no IP yet" and hand
# write_ssh_alias() nothing to write — which, by design (repo#216), leaves the
# PREVIOUS session's now-wrong HostName in place. Nothing in the old output
# distinguished that silent staleness from a host that has no public IP on
# purpose, so the exhausted-budget case below says so explicitly.
#
# "Not yet" for retry purposes means any of: an empty value, the AWS CLI's
# literal "None" rendering of a null scalar, or an outright API-call failure
# (throttling / a transient error — exactly the case worth retrying).
# aws_public_ip() still surfaces the underlying stderr on every failing attempt,
# so nothing is swallowed; the budget is what keeps this from hanging.
#
# The budget is deliberately small (6 attempts, 2s apart => ~10s worst case) and
# is overridable via REPO_REMOTE_IP_POLL_ATTEMPTS / REPO_REMOTE_IP_POLL_INTERVAL
# so the test suite can drive both the late-IP and exhausted paths without real
# sleeps. Both overrides are validated: a non-numeric (or zero) attempt count
# falls back to the default rather than degenerating into "never poll" or an

# against a group that cannot admit SSH) and when REUSING an existing instance
# (repo#451).
#
# Why reuse needs it too: the authorized CIDR is pinned to whatever the
# operator's IP was at ORIGINAL create time. Laptop IPs move (the reported
# incident: 52.119.115.124 -> 104.7.12.215 between sessions), so restarting an
# instance that was created days ago left ingress pointing at an address that no
# longer reaches it — an SSH timeout whose only fix was revoking/re-authorizing
# the /32 by hand. Re-running the chain on reuse re-authorizes for the CURRENTLY
# detected CIDR, so `up` self-heals instead.
#
# Repeating it is safe: the group is RESOLVED (explicit REPO_REMOTE_SECURITY_GROUP,
# else the repo-remote=<name> tag) rather than created per run, and a duplicate
# tcp/22 rule is treated as success by aws_authorize_ssh_ingress.
#
# --no-create (the reuse path) additionally refuses to CREATE a group when none
# resolves, and logs a notice instead. Creating one there would be worse than
# doing nothing: the new group is not attached to the already-running instance,
# so it would neither restore SSH nor be reachable — it would just leak an
# unused group per repo while *looking* like the ingress had been repaired.
# (repo#176's "no new SG accumulates per invocation" property, asserted by the
# suite, says the same thing.) The same limitation applies whenever a reused
# instance is attached to some OTHER group (created outside this tooling, or
# before repo#176): the group refreshed here is not the one guarding it, and
# that group has to be fixed by hand.
#
# --no-create also never WIDENS an existing rule on a failed IP detection — see
