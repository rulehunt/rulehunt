#!/usr/bin/env bash
# resync-installed.sh — refresh this repo's installed Repo Skills surfaces from
# the source clone they were installed from.
#
# This is requirement **C7** of INSTALLER-CONTRACT.md (the tool-package installer
# contract this repo owns): a consumer-side, non-destructive refresh the consumer
# can run itself, rather than a full installer invocation driven from outside.
#
#   Usage: resync-installed.sh [--dry-run] [--quiet] [--source <path>] [--target <path>]
#
#   --dry-run, -n     Report the drift and change nothing. Exit 2 if any file
#                     would be created/updated, 0 if already in sync.
#   --quiet, -q       Print only warnings, errors, and the one-line summary.
#   --source <path>   Source clone to resync from. Default: resolved from the
#                     machine-local sidecar, then the legacy inline field (the
#                     C6 order — see "Resolving the source" below).
#   --target <path>   Consumer repo to refresh. Default: the git top level of the
#                     current working directory.
#   --help, -h        This text.
#
# Exit status: 0 = in sync (or successfully applied); 2 = --dry-run found drift;
# 1 = error (nothing installed here, source unresolvable, or a write failed).
# These are the same three codes /repo:update-tools already documents for Loom's
# resync, so a caller can drive either tool with one branch.
#
# WHAT IT TOUCHES — the pure-copy surface map install.sh writes, plus ONE
# targeted field edit (not a copy — see the CLAUDE.md entry under OUT OF SCOPE
# below for the split) it shares with install.sh:
#   .claude/skills/repo/SKILL.md                        <- skills/repo/SKILL.md
#   .claude/skills/repo/hooks/*.sh                      <- hooks/repo/*.sh
#   .claude/skills/repo/scripts/repo-remote.sh          <- scripts/repo/repo-remote.sh
#   .claude/skills/repo/scripts/repo-scrub-forks.sh     <- scripts/repo/repo-scrub-forks.sh
#   .claude/skills/repo/scripts/resync-installed.sh     <- scripts/repo/resync-installed.sh
#   .claude/commands/repo/<cmd>.md                      <- commands/repo/<cmd>.md
#   .agents/skills/repo/SKILL.md                        <- skills/repo/SKILL.md (Codex form)
#   .agents/skills/repo/references/<cmd>.md             <- commands/repo/<cmd>.md
#   CLAUDE.md (REPO-SKILLS block, restamped to $VERSION) <- targeted field edit, not a copy
#
# The Codex half is refreshed ONLY when it is already installed and carries this
# package's ownership marker. A repo installed before Codex packaging existed, or
# one whose operator declined it with `install.sh --no-codex`, is left without
# it: a refresh must not quietly add a surface nobody asked for. Re-run install.sh
# to adopt it (that is what the layout_version warning below is telling you).
#
# EXPLICITLY OUT OF SCOPE (owned by install.sh / uninstall.sh, not by resync),
# WITH ONE NARROW EXCEPTION for CLAUDE.md's version token (repo#407):
#   .claude/settings.json  - hook wiring is a JSON merge into a file the consumer
#                            also owns; re-run install.sh if the wiring is missing
#   CLAUDE.md              - the REPO-SKILLS marker block's BOILERPLATE PROSE
#                            (wording, structure) is install.sh's alone — a full
#                            block rewrite only ever happens there. Resync DOES
#                            own the "v<version>" token inside that block, the
#                            same way it already owns install-metadata.json's
#                            version field: every run restamps the whole block
#                            to the source's current $VERSION, so the two can
#                            never disagree (the bug this exception fixes: a
#                            resync from N->M used to leave metadata at M while
#                            this block kept reading vN). A block that was never
#                            installed, or whose destination is gitignored, is
#                            left alone either way — resync never adds or
#                            un-hides one, mirroring install.sh's own opt-outs.
#   .gitignore             - the sidecar-ignore entry, written by install.sh
#   config.json            - consumer-owned guard toggles; never generated here
#
# IT NEVER UNINSTALLS. There is no code path in this file that removes a file in
# the target: the only `rm` calls target temp files this script itself created.
# A file under the installed surfaces with no counterpart in the source (a
# consumer-local command, a command dropped upstream, a stale copy) is reported
# and LEFT ALONE. Removing installed surfaces is uninstall.sh's job, and it must
# stay a separate, explicit action — a refresh that can delete is not a refresh.
#
# RESOLVING THE SOURCE (contract C6 order, implemented rather than restated):
#   1. --source <path>, when given.
#   2. .claude/skills/repo/.install-local.json -> "source" (the gitignored,
#      machine-local sidecar).
#   3. install-metadata.json -> "source" (pre-split installs embedded it inline).
#   4. Otherwise: error. A source clone is required — this script refreshes FROM
#      something; it cannot invent the new bytes.
#
# ATOMIC WRITES + DEFERRED SELF-UPDATE: every file is written by rendering into a
# temp file NEXT TO its destination and rename(2)-ing it into place, never by
# truncating the destination. That matters most for this script, which is itself
# one of the files it refreshes: a rename swaps the directory entry and leaves
# the inode the running bash is still reading from intact. Belt-and-braces, the
# self-copy is also applied LAST, after every other surface has settled.
#
# NOT Loom's resync-installed.sh. Loom ships a same-named script under
# .loom/scripts/ that always resolves its target against the PRIMARY worktree,
# which is why Loom's Builder role forbids running it from an issue worktree.
# This one has no such hazard: `.claude/` is an ordinary per-worktree directory,
# so the target is simply the git top level of the current working directory and
# writes land where you are standing. There is no --allow-worktree escape hatch
# because there is nothing to escape.
#
# WORKS WITHOUT jq. jq is used when present; otherwise a flat-JSON fallback reads
# the same fields, because install.sh generates these files in a fixed shape and
# a consumer-side script must not hard-depend on a tool the consumer may lack.

# a marker span inside a consumer-owned file, so this reuses
# claude_md_block_rewrite() (repo#38) directly instead.
#
# Silently does nothing when:
#   - CLAUDE.md has no REPO-SKILLS block at all (never installed, or removed) —
#     resync must not add one, same as the Codex surface's opt-in-only gate.
#   - the commands destination is gitignored — mirrors install.sh's own skip.
#   - the source clone predates lib/claude-md-block.sh (CLAUDE_MD_BLOCK_AVAILABLE).
# A present-but-unresolvable marker layout (repo#38's failure mode: another
# tool's block glued onto this one with no intervening newline) is reported as
# a FAILURE, exactly like install.sh's own refusal-and-warn — never guessed at.
