# Repo Skills

General-purpose tools for keeping a git repository healthy and productive. The
hygiene commands **apply their safe, reversible fixes by default** and report
each change; add `--ask` to review findings and confirm first. Anything
irreversible — deleting a branch, worktree, stash, or untracked file — is never
automatic: it takes an explicit opt-in and passes a permanent-loss check.
Commands whose only action is consequential (`orphans`, `update-tools`, `deps`,
`followups`, `release`, `remote`, `sudo`) always confirm first by nature. The environment commands (`remote`) stand up
infrastructure only after showing exactly what they will create and what it
costs.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| [[help]] | Explain the installed `/repo:*` commands — what each does, where to start |
| [[all]] | The whole hygiene pass in order — audit, scrub, docs, tidy, update-tools, reset — safe fixes by default, destructive steps gated |
| [[audit]] | Full sweep — runs all hygiene checks, produces a summary report |
| [[scrub]] | Public-surface scrub — scan code, history, issues, PRs (and forks) for sensitive identifiers, and report which findings can actually be removed. Report-only; severity gates verbosity so it stays quiet inside [[all]]. Its fork-network sweep is implemented in `scripts/repo/repo-scrub-forks.sh` (installed to `.claude/skills/repo/scripts/`) |
| [[reset]] | Back to baseline — review stale worktrees/branches/stashes, sync with remote, return to the default branch |
| [[handoff]] | Roll the session safely — file follow-ups, reset, check for a CLI update, write a handoff note the next session reads first |
| [[tidy]] | Tidy up — build artifacts, caches, temp files, empty dirs |
| [[release]] | Cut a release — pre-flight, semver decision, CHANGELOG, version bump, tag, GitHub Release. Supports per-project release policy via named phase-boundary seams in `.repo/release-policy.md` |
| [[host-optimize]] | Prepare a Mac (or Linux box) for heavy Loom/agent build use — audit Gatekeeper churn, backup-agent interference, build-tree bloat; apply safe fixes, gate consequential ones |
| [[remote]] | Launch a cloud dev session (GCP or AWS) with this repo ready to go, then open SSH. Its provisioning contract is implemented once in `scripts/repo/repo-remote.sh` (installed to `.claude/skills/repo/scripts/`); the interactive flow delegates to that script, which also serves as a headless `repo-remote up --yes --json` entry point for non-interactive callers (e.g. loom's `fleet add-worker`) |
| [[sudo]] | Opt-in passwordless-sudo setup for a dev machine — install a `visudo`-validated `/etc/sudoers.d` drop-in (blanket `ALL` or a scoped command list) so an agent over SSH isn't blocked on password prompts; always confirmed first, validated with rollback on failure |
| [[update-tools]] | Check installed tool packages (Loom, Anvil, …) against their sources and offer updates |
| [[deps]] | Third-party dependency currency — reconcile organization policy, Renovate or Dependabot setup, and bot PRs; report-only under `--check` |
| [[org-policy]] | Preview or deploy canonical rjwalters/repo preferences to the client's GitHub owner/.github repository through a policy PR |
| [[followups]] | Capture follow-on work from this session and file it as issues — here or in upstream tool repos, always confirmed first |
| [[branches]] | Branch & worktree hygiene — merged PRs, orphaned branches, stale worktrees |
| [[gitignore]] | Gitignore hygiene — over-ignored files, under-ignored build artifacts |
| [[docs]] | Documentation health — content accuracy, README structure, cross-references (canonical docs command) |
| [[links]] | Internal cross-references — markdown links, CLAUDE.md paths, skill graph |
| [[orphans]] | Files with no references — dead scripts, stale data, outputs without sources |
| [[readme]] | README accuracy vs actual directory contents |

## When to Use

- After finishing a task, to get back to a known-good state (`reset`)
- After a large refactor, consolidation, or import (`audit`, `docs`)
- When the working tree feels messy (`tidy`, `orphans`)
- When `git branch` output has grown unmanageable (`branches`)
- When local hardware isn't enough or you need a clean Linux box (`remote`)
- Before turning a Mac into a heavy Loom/agent build host (`host-optimize`)
- To unblock an agent driving a dev box over SSH from `sudo` password prompts (`sudo`)
- Periodically, to keep installed tool packages current (`update-tools`) and
  third-party dependencies current — organization policy, updater setup, and bot-PR triage (`deps`)
- To preview or install organization preferences from a client repo (`org-policy`)
- Periodically (monthly) as general hygiene (`audit`)
- Before making a repo public, and periodically after — to check what the
  public surface actually exposes (`scrub`)
- Before a demo, handoff, or onboarding (clean up before they arrive)

## Principles

1. **Apply safe fixes, gate destructive ones.** Reversible fixes (doc/link/
   gitignore edits, regenerable clutter) apply by default and are reported as
   they're made; `--ask` restores review-and-confirm. Irreversible actions
   — deleting branches, worktrees, stashes, untracked files, or creating
   infrastructure — are never automatic: show the plan (and cost, for cloud
   resources), run the permanent-loss check, and act only on explicit opt-in.
2. **Scope matters.** Most hygiene commands accept an optional path argument to
   limit scope (e.g., `/repo:readme docs/`). Without it, they scan the full repo.
3. **General by design.** These commands make no assumptions about org,
   project structure, or infrastructure. Anything repo-specific is read from
   the consumer repo's own files (CLAUDE.md conventions, `.env`),
   never hardcoded.
4. **Don't be noisy.** Only flag things that are actually wrong or confusing.
   A missing README in a tiny utility directory isn't worth flagging.

## Destructive-command guard (PreToolUse hook)

Installing Repo Skills also wires a **PreToolUse safety hook** —
`.claude/skills/repo/hooks/guard-destructive.sh` — into the consumer repo's
`.claude/settings.json`. This is the **canonical generic destructive-command
guard** (rjwalters/repo#30). It runs before every agent `Bash` command and:

- **Blocks** catastrophic operations outright: `rm -rf` of root / `$HOME` / a
  top-level system dir (with lexical `..`/`//` normalization so traversal
  can't smuggle one past), `rm` targets outside the repo/temp scope (see
  `rmScope` below), force-push to `main`/`master`, fork bombs, piping a
  download to a shell (`curl … | sh` — only when the pipe target *is* a
  shell), `gh repo delete`/`archive`, `docker system prune`, cloud destruction
  (`aws iam delete`, `aws s3 rb`, `aws cloudformation delete-stack`,
  `az … delete`, `gcloud … delete`), system-lifecycle commands
  (`halt`/`reboot`/`poweroff`/`shutdown`/`init 0|6`, command-word matched so
  prose never trips), and SQL DDL/DML (`DROP TABLE`, `TRUNCATE TABLE`,
  `DELETE FROM …` without a `WHERE`).
- **Asks** for confirmation on risky-but-legitimate ones: force ops
  (`git push --force` / `git reset --hard`, branch-aware via `forceScope`),
  `git clean -fd`, un-isolated `git read-tree`, mutating cloud verbs
  (`aws ec2 run|terminate|stop-…`, `aws s3 cp|rm|sync`, `docker rm|stop|…` —
  read-only `describe*`/`ls`/`get*` never prompt), `kubectl delete`,
  `gh release delete`, credential reads (`cat ~/.ssh/…`), etc.
- **Allows** everything else — scoped deletes like `rm -rf node_modules` or
  `/tmp` subpaths, and obviously read-only commands (`git status`, `ls`,
  `grep`, …) via a structural fast path that skips the pattern gauntlet.

**Deferral by other tooling is conditional, and as of 0.9.0 it holds**
(rjwalters/repo#168, #188). Loom wires its own
`.loom/hooks/guard-destructive.sh` as the registered hook; that script is a
dispatcher which `exec`s this canonical guard only when the copy it finds
passes both a version probe **and** a capability probe for Bash-tool write
confinement (`grep -q 'worktree-write-confinement'`). This guard implements
that category and emits the marker, so the dispatcher now prefers it.

The probe is a **single marker that switches which guard runs entirely**, not a
per-feature advertisement — so emitting it while behind on any other category
would silently downgrade protection fleet-wide. It was therefore gated on
behavioral parity with the vendored copy, established by diffing both guards'
deny/allow decisions across the pattern surface rather than by counting
functions. Two classes of gap were closed:

- **`git stash` had no coverage here at all.** `pop`/`drop`/`clear` were
  allowed silently while the vendored guard asked. `refs/stash` is a single
  stack shared across every linked worktree, so this is how one agent destroys
  another's WIP. Now gated by `guards.stashScope` / `REPO_GUARD_STASH_SCOPE`.
- **Four checks scanned the raw command** (`COMMAND_NO_COMMENT`, or `COMMAND`)
  instead of the literal-redacted `COMMAND_ASK_SCAN`: SQL DDL, force ops, cloud
  CLI, and `rm -rf` scope. That made this guard deny ordinary prose — filing an
  issue that quoted a destructive statement, or committing a note mentioning
  one. The vendored copy had always scanned the redacted copy.

One deliberate divergence remains: `aws iam delete-role` is a hard **deny**
here and an ask in the vendored copy, so the switch makes a Loom-managed repo
stricter on IAM deletion rather than weaker.

A second, narrower divergence (#195): the vendored guard's ASK-tier positional-
argument masking (`mask_ask_positional_args()`) carries one hardcoded allowlist
entry, `./.loom/scripts/check-duplicate.sh` — always masked, with no way to
extend or disable it per repo. This guard ports the same masking mechanism but
makes the allowlist a `guards.positionalMaskAllowlist` config array instead
(empty/absent by default, so it is a no-op on every repo that hasn't opted
in — see "Configuring per repo" below). It does **not** carry the vendored
copy's hardcoded entry, since `check-duplicate.sh` is a Loom-specific script
this repo doesn't ship: a repo that relies on the vendored copy's built-in
masking for that script and switches to this guard must add it explicitly via
config, or the switch is (by default) stricter for that one command — more
asks, never fewer. `grep`/`egrep`/`fgrep`/`rg` **and** `cp`/`mv`/`tee`/`sed`
can never be added to the allowlist here regardless of config: the working
copy this masking narrows (`COMMAND_ASK_SCAN`) also feeds two **deny**-tier
scans — the SQL DDL/DML check (which reads a `grep '<pattern>' file`
invocation's own quoted pattern, the vendored copy's reason for excluding the
grep family) and the #4178 Bash-tool write-confinement check (which extracts
`cp`/`mv`/`tee`/`sed` write targets from that same text). Masking either
scan's subject would silently downgrade a hard deny to an allow, so the
exclusion set is hardcoded and not operator-overridable. **Only allowlist a
command whose positional arguments are inert text it merely reads** — never
one that acts on them (writes them as paths, executes them as statements).
See `positional_mask_cmdre()`'s consumer audit table in
`guard-destructive.sh`. Loom's vendored copy can adopt the same configurable
mechanism to drop its hardcoded path (rjwalters/loom#5660).

Precision features ported from Loom's guard: quote-aware command segmentation
(a `|` inside quotes is not a pipe), literal-text redaction (a dangerous phrase
quoted in `--body`/`-m`/`--title`/`--notes`/`--comment` values doesn't trip the
scan — command substitution inside such a value still does), comment stripping,
and an opt-in JSONL decision-telemetry log for measuring guard friction.

The hook only fires when Claude Code runs with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`
(it is skipped entirely under `--permission-mode bypassPermissions`).

### Configuring per repo

All toggles resolve: `REPO_*` env var (wins) → legacy `LOOM_*` env var →
`guards.<key>` in `.claude/skills/repo/config.json` (wins) → legacy
`.loom/config.json` → default. On/off values: `0`/`false`/`no` and
`1`/`true`/`yes`.

| Toggle | Env var (wins) | Legacy env var | Config key | Default |
|--------|----------------|----------------|------------|---------|
| Read-only fast path | `REPO_GUARD_READONLY_FASTPATH` | `LOOM_GUARD_READONLY_FASTPATH` | `guards.readOnlyFastPath` (+ extend-only `guards.readOnlyFastPathExtra`) | on |
| ASK-tier positional-arg masking allowlist | — (config-only) | — | `guards.positionalMaskAllowlist` (array of command names; grep/egrep/fgrep/rg and cp/mv/tee/sed can never be added — they are the subjects of deny-tier scans) | `[]` (no-op) |
| SQL DDL/DML | `REPO_GUARD_SQL` | `LOOM_GUARD_SQL` | `guards.sqlDdl` | on |
| Cloud CLI (mutating-verb asks + `az`/`gcloud` delete denies) | `REPO_GUARD_CLOUD` | `LOOM_GUARD_CLOUD` | `guards.cloudCli` | on |
| Reversible-GitHub asks (`gh pr/issue close`, `gh label delete`) | `REPO_GUARD_REVERSIBLE_GH` | `LOOM_GUARD_REVERSIBLE_GH` | `guards.reversibleGh` | **off** (opt-in) |
| rm scope (`repo` denies outside-repo/temp targets; `off`/`permissive` restores legacy) | `REPO_RM_SCOPE` | `LOOM_RM_SCOPE` | `guards.rmScope` | `repo` |
| Force-op branch scope (`all` / `protected` / `off`) | `REPO_FORCE_SCOPE` | `LOOM_FORCE_SCOPE` | `guards.forceScope` | `all` |
| Decision telemetry log | `REPO_GUARD_DECISION_LOG` (path: `REPO_GUARD_DECISION_LOG_FILE`) | `LOOM_GUARD_DECISION_LOG` (`…_FILE`) | `guards.decisionLog` | **off** (opt-in) |

For the on-by-default guards only an explicit `false` disables — a missing key
or malformed config keeps the guard on; the opt-in toggles are the inverse.

```json
// .claude/skills/repo/config.json
{ "guards": { "sqlDdl": false, "cloudCli": true, "forceScope": "protected" } }
```

**`rmScope`'s unresolved-shell-variable policy (#239).** `extract_rm_targets()`
is a tokenizer, not a shell evaluator: an `rm` target of `"$p"` reaches the
scope check with the `$p` reference unexpanded. The naive resolution — treat
anything that doesn't start with `/` as CWD-relative — silently reinterprets
an unresolvable target as repo-relative, which is the ONE interpretation
guaranteed to pass the in-scope check regardless of what the variable actually
expands to at runtime (`rm -rf "$p"` at a repo cwd, `$p` really pointing
outside the repo, was wrongly allowed). Deleting is not recoverable, so
`guards.rmScope=repo` fails **closed** on an unresolvable target rather than
guessing, mirroring the Bash-tool write-confinement category's own posture on
the same ambiguity (`#4921`/`#4927`).

The guard takes the deliberate **middle option** between "deny every
unresolvable target" (breaks every scripted `rm` loop, including ones fully
inside the repo) and "keep guessing" (this issue): deny only when the
variable is the **path root** — nothing literal precedes the first unexpanded
`$` (`rm -rf "$p"`, `rm -rf "$(mktemp -d)"`, `rm -rf "/$X/evil"`). A variable
in a *later* directory component, with a real literal root before it
(`rm -rf "build-artifacts/$sub/tmp"`), is instead resolved as far as the
literal text allows and only the **known prefix** — everything before the
first unexpanded `$` — is scope-tested: in scope → allowed (the delete stays
inside the area `rmScope=repo` already permits), not in scope or unusable →
denied. A `$` that appears only in the trailing/final path component
(`rm -rf build-artifacts/tmp/$stamp`) needs none of this, since the directory
portion is fully literal either way, and keeps its existing (unaffected)
treatment.

This is the **opposite polarity** from write-confinement's equivalent
known-prefix case, which *denies* an in-scope prefix (there, an unresolvable
directory component inside the protected area could still let a **write**
escape it). For `rm`-scope the risk runs the other way — a **delete** landing
*outside* the repo — so a known-in-scope prefix is exactly the evidence that
risk did not materialize, and the target is allowed. See
`hooks/repo/guard-destructive.sh` (search `#239`) for the implementation and
`hooks/repo/tests/test-guard-destructive.sh`'s "rm-scope unresolved shell
variable in target (#239)" section for the pinned cases in both directions.
This policy only applies while `guards.rmScope=repo` is active — with
`rmScope:"off"`/`"permissive"` the legacy CWD-relative fallback is unchanged,
so the opt-out stays byte-for-byte permissive.

**Affected caller: `commands/repo/sudo.md` (#245).** All four `rm` calls in
that command (`sudo rm -f "$DROPIN"` and `rm -f "$TMP"`, each root-unresolved
— the variable is the entire target) are denied under the default
`guards.rmScope=repo`. Unlike the write-confinement guard's own affected
caller note in the same file, this trigger is **config-only and defaults to
`repo`** — it has no "only when a managed worktree exists" carve-out, so it
is not avoided by running outside a Loom-managed checkout the way the write
denials are. See the "Guard note" in `commands/repo/sudo.md` for the
per-call-site manual remedy.

The full stable interface (input/output contract, exit semantics, every env
name) is documented in the hook's own header — downstream tools (e.g. Loom's
installer) gate on it via this repo's release version.

## Handoff-note hook (SessionStart)

The installer wires a second hook, `session-start-handoff.sh`, as two
`SessionStart` entries — one matching `startup`, one matching `resume`. When
[[handoff]] has left a note at `.claude/handoff.md`, the hook emits it as
session context via `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`: the note's path,
its age, a staleness warning once the note passes seven days, and the note
itself. When the note is at or under a size cap (`MAX_BODY_BYTES`, 10 KB) the
**full body is inlined**; above the cap it falls back to an outline built from
the note's `#`/`##` headers plus an explicit oversize warning. Inlining the body
is deliberate (issue #33): the load-bearing content lives in the body, and a
headers-only summary conveys shape but nothing actionable.

Behavioral contract:

- **Read-only.** It never writes, deletes, or modifies the note. Absorbing the
  note and deleting it is [[handoff]]'s own one-shot contract.
- **Silent when there is nothing to say.** No note, or an unreadable one, means
  no output and exit 0.
- **Fails open.** Malformed stdin, a missing `cwd`, or any internal error exits
  0 with no output. A hook fault must never block session start.
- **Skips `/clear`.** `clear` is not a process relaunch, so re-emitting the
  banner there would be noise.

**Sibling visibility (opt-in, off by default).** A note is repo-scoped, so "no
note in this repo" and "no note anywhere" are indistinguishable at session
start. Export `REPO_HANDOFF_SIBLING_ROOT=<dir of checkouts>` and — *only* when
the current repo has no note of its own — the hook also lists which repos
directly under that root do have one, **path and age only, never the body**.
The scan is single-level (`"$ROOT"/*/.claude/handoff.md`), capped at
`MAX_SIBLING_DIRS` (64) directories examined, never `cd`s into a sibling or
writes anything, and fails open to silence on a missing or unreadable root.
Unset, the hook behaves exactly as it did before the variable existed.

That variable is the hook's only configuration toggle. To disable the hook
entirely, remove its `SessionStart` entries from `.claude/settings.json` (or run
`uninstall.sh`, which removes only the entries it owns).

## Refreshing this install (`resync-installed.sh`)

Everything above is a **copy** made at install time, so a fix merged upstream
does not reach this repo on its own. `.claude/skills/repo/scripts/resync-installed.sh`
refreshes the copied surfaces from the source clone recorded in the
machine-local sidecar:

```bash
.claude/skills/repo/scripts/resync-installed.sh --dry-run   # report drift, write nothing
.claude/skills/repo/scripts/resync-installed.sh             # apply
```

It is idempotent, reports per-file created/updated/unchanged/skipped, skips
symlinked (`--dev`) destinations, and **never removes a file** — anything with
no source counterpart is named and left alone. Exit status: `0` in sync, `2`
from `--dry-run` when drift was found, `1` on error. `--quiet` reduces it to a
one-line summary; `--source` / `--target` override the resolved paths.

Hook wiring in `.claude/settings.json`, the `CLAUDE.md` block, and `.gitignore`
belong to `install.sh`, not to a refresh — re-run the installer if those need
updating. This split is requirement **C7** of the normative
[tool-package installer contract](https://github.com/rjwalters/repo/blob/main/INSTALLER-CONTRACT.md),
which [[update-tools]] follows for every tool in the family.
