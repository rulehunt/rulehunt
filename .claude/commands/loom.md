# Assume Loom Role

Randomly select and assume an archetypal role from the Loom orchestration system, then perform one iteration of work following that role's guidelines.

## Process

1. **List available roles**: Check `defaults/roles/*.md` or `.loom/roles/*.md`
2. **Select one at random**: Use current timestamp or random selection
3. **Read the role definition**: Load the markdown file for the selected role
4. **Follow the role's workflow**: Complete ONE iteration only (one task, one PR review, one issue triage, etc.)
5. **Report results**: Summarize what you accomplished with links to issues/PRs modified

## Available Roles

- **builder.md** - Claim `loom:ready` issue, implement feature/fix, create PR with `loom:review-requested`
- **judge.md** - Review PR with `loom:review-requested`, approve or request changes, update labels
- **curator.md** - Find unlabeled issue, enhance with technical details, mark as `loom:ready`
- **architect.md** - Create architectural proposal issue with `loom:architect-suggestion` label
- **hermit.md** - Analyze codebase complexity, create bloat removal issue with `loom:critic-suggestion`
- **healer.md** - Fix bug or address PR feedback, maintain existing PRs
- **guide.md** - Triage batch of issues, update priorities and labels for workflow
- **driver.md** - Execute direct task or command (plain shell, no specific workflow)

## Work Scope

Complete **ONE** meaningful task following the selected role's guidelines, then **stop and report**.

### Task Examples by Role

**Builder**: Claim one `loom:ready` issue â†’ implement â†’ test â†’ commit â†’ create PR
**Judge**: Review one PR with `loom:review-requested` â†’ provide feedback â†’ approve/request changes
**Curator**: Find one unlabeled issue â†’ add context â†’ tag as `loom:ready`
**Architect**: Identify one architectural need â†’ create detailed proposal issue
**Hermit**: Analyze codebase section â†’ identify bloat â†’ create removal issue
**Healer**: Fix one bug or address one PR comment â†’ update PR â†’ push changes
**Guide**: Review issue backlog â†’ update priorities â†’ add/remove labels for batch
**Driver**: Execute one direct command or task per user instruction

## Report Format

After completing your iteration, report:

```
âœ“ Role Assumed: [Role Name]
âœ“ Task Completed: [Brief description]
âœ“ Changes Made:
  - [Issue/PR #XXX]: [Description with link]
  - [Label changes]
  - [Files modified if applicable]
âœ“ Next Steps: [Suggestions for follow-up or ready state]
```

## Label Workflow

Follow the label-based coordination system (ADR-0006):

- Issues: `loom:ready` â†’ `loom:in-progress` â†’ closed
- PRs: `loom:review-requested` â†’ `loom:approved` â†’ merged
- Proposals: `loom:architect-suggestion` â†’ reviewed â†’ implemented or closed
- Suggestions: `loom:critic-suggestion` â†’ reviewed â†’ implemented or closed

## Notes

- This command simulates one terminal's work in the Loom multi-terminal orchestration system
- Multiple Claude Code sessions can run `/loom` in parallel for distributed work
- Each iteration should be atomic and complete (don't leave partial work)
- Always update labels appropriately to signal state to other roles
- Check for existing work to avoid conflicts (e.g., don't claim already `in-progress` issues)

## Example Usage

```bash
# In Claude Code terminal
/loom

# Claude responds:
"ðŸŽ­ Rolling random role... Assuming the Judge role for this iteration.
