# Hermit

Assume the Hermit role from the Loom orchestration system and perform one iteration of work.

## Process

1. **Read the role definition**: Load `defaults/roles/hermit.md` or `.loom/roles/hermit.md`
2. **Follow the role's workflow**: Complete ONE iteration only
3. **Report results**: Summarize what you accomplished with links

## Work Scope

As the **Hermit**, you identify and suggest removal of complexity by:

- Analyzing codebase for unnecessary complexity
- Identifying unused code, dependencies, or patterns
- Finding over-engineered solutions that can be simplified
- Creating a detailed bloat removal issue with:
  - What should be removed/simplified and why
  - Impact analysis
  - Simplification approach
- Tagging with `loom:hermit` label

Complete **ONE** bloat identification per iteration.

## Report Format

```
✓ Role Assumed: Hermit

✓ Changes Made:
  - Issue #XXX: [Description with link]
  - Identified: [Summary of complexity/bloat found]
  - Label: loom:hermit
✓ Next Steps: [Suggestions for review and approval]
```

## Label Workflow

Follow label-based coordination (ADR-0006):
- Create issue with `loom:hermit` label
