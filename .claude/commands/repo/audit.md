# /repo:audit — Full Health Sweep

Run a full health sweep of the repository (or a specific subtree). Reports
findings grouped by category and severity. Does not make changes — presents
findings for discussion.

## Usage

```
/repo:audit                    # Full repo
/repo:audit packages/core      # Scope to one subtree
```

## What It Checks

Run each of the following checks and compile results into a single report:

### 1. README Accuracy (see [[readme]])
- Browsable directory levels that lack a README (top-level and significant
  subdirs — so GitHub renders docs at each level someone navigates to)
- READMEs whose file/folder listings don't match actual contents
- Stale "gitignored" or "TODO" annotations that are no longer true

### 2. Orphaned Files (see [[orphans]])
- Scripts not referenced by any other file, Makefile, or CI config
- Data files (.yaml, .json, .csv) not imported or referenced anywhere
- Generated outputs (PDFs, binaries) without a corresponding source

### 3. Broken Links (see [[links]])
- Markdown links (`[text](path)`) pointing to nonexistent files
- CLAUDE.md paths that don't resolve
- Skill/command cross-references to missing files
- Links inside an **install-template tree** (an installer's `defaults/`, a
  cookiecutter skeleton) resolve at their installed destination when the repo
  declares the mapping in `.repo/link-roots.json`. Fold [[links]]' mapping table
  into this report and say which mapping resolved a link — a mapping fails by
  hiding errors, so it has to show its work. With no declaration, resolution is
  unchanged.
- A relative link that resolves **outside the repo root** (a citation into a
  sibling repo in a multi-repo workspace) is checked against
  `.repo/link-siblings.json` when the repo declares one. Report it distinctly:
  `resolved via sibling repo` when the checkout is present and the target
  exists, a normal `MISSING` finding when the checkout is present but the
  target is gone, and `sibling repo not present — unverifiable` — never
  `MISSING` — when the sibling isn't checked out on this machine at all. With
  no declaration, out-of-repo links are handled exactly as they are today.

### 4. Gitignore Issues (see [[gitignore]])
- Files that are ignored but probably shouldn't be
- Build artifacts that aren't ignored but should be
- Redundant or stale gitignore rules — but **not** `X` + `X/` pairs unless `X`
  is verified to be a real, non-symlink directory (`[ -d "X" ] && [ ! -L "X" ]`);
  see [[gitignore]] for the full check. A trailing slash never matches a
  symlink, so wrongly deduping such a pair silently un-ignores one.

### 5. Branch & Worktree Hygiene (see [[branches]])
- Local branches whose PRs are merged
- Orphaned or stale worktrees

### Out of scope: host posture (see [[host-optimize]])

This is a repo-scoped audit. The **host** a machine presents to heavy build
workloads — Gatekeeper scan churn, backup-agent interference, build-tree bloat,
sudo/concurrency posture — is not checked here. For a build host, run
[[host-optimize]] instead; unlike this read-only audit, that command applies its
safe-tier fixes by default.

## Output Format

Present findings as a table grouped by category:

```
## Repo Audit — packages/core

### README Issues (2 findings)
| Severity | Path | Issue |
|----------|------|-------|
| warn | docs/analysis/ | No README, 8 files |
| info | README.md | Lists `sim/` but dir doesn't exist |

### Orphaned Files (1 finding)
...

### Summary
- 2 README issues (0 critical, 1 warn, 1 info)
- 1 orphan (0 critical, 0 warn, 1 info)
- 0 broken links (3 resolved via install mapping)
- 0 gitignore issues
- 3 stale branches
```

After presenting, ask: "Want me to fix any of these?"

## Severity Levels

- **critical**: Something is actively misleading or broken (dead link in
  CLAUDE.md, gitignore rule hiding important files)
- **warn**: Should be fixed but isn't causing immediate harm (stale README,
  orphaned script)
- **info**: Nice to fix, low priority (missing README in a small directory)
