# Claude Code Settings

This directory contains Claude Code configuration for the Loom project.

## Files

- **`settings.json`**: Team-wide permissions and settings (committed to git)
- **`settings.local.json`**: Personal preferences (gitignored, create if needed)
- **`../.mcp.json`**: MCP server configuration (at project root, committed to git)

## Pre-approved Commands

The `settings.json` file pre-approves common development commands to streamline the AI workflow:

### GitHub CLI (`gh`)
- PR operations: create, edit, view, list, checkout, diff, review, checks
- Issue operations: create, edit, view, list, close
- Workflow runs: view

### Git Operations
- Status, add, commit, push, pull, fetch, merge
- Branch management: checkout, branch, log, diff
- Working tree operations: restore, stash, reset, clean
- Worktree operations: add
- Configuration: config, check-ignore

### Package Management
- `pnpm install` - Install dependencies
- `pnpm build` - Build project
- `pnpm tauri:dev` - Run Tauri dev server
- `pnpm daemon:dev` - Run daemon in dev mode
- `pnpm check:all` - Run all checks
- `pnpm check:ci` - Run CI checks locally

### Code Quality
- `pnpm lint` - Biome linting
- `pnpm format` - Biome formatting
- `pnpm clippy` - Rust linting
- `pnpm test` - Run tests

### Rust/Cargo
- `cargo check` - Check compilation
- `cargo build` - Build project
- `cargo test` - Run tests

### Utilities
- File operations: cat, ls, pwd, cd, mkdir
- Image conversion: convert, magick, iconutil
- Terminal management: tmux list-sessions
- Web search: Enabled

## Local Overrides

Create `.claude/settings.local.json` for personal preferences:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(your custom command:*)"
    ]
  }
}
```

Local settings override team settings for that specific configuration key.

## MCP Servers

The project includes two MCP servers configured in `.mcp.json`:

### loom-logs
Monitor Loom application logs:
- `tail_daemon_log` - View daemon logs (`~/.loom/daemon.log`)
- `tail_tauri_log` - View Tauri app logs (`~/.loom/tauri.log`)
- `list_terminal_logs` - List terminal output files
- `tail_terminal_log` - View specific terminal output

### loom-terminals
Interact with Loom terminal sessions:
- `list_terminals` - List all active terminals
- `get_terminal_output` - Read terminal output
- `get_selected_terminal` - Get current terminal info
- `send_terminal_input` - Execute commands in terminals

### loom-ui
Interact with the Loom application UI and state:
- `read_console_log` - View browser console output (JavaScript errors, console.log statements)
- `read_state_file` - Read current application state (.loom/state.json)
- `read_config_file` - Read terminal configurations (.loom/config.json)
- `trigger_start` - Trigger workspace start with confirmation dialog (factory reset with 6 terminals)
- `trigger_force_start` - Trigger force start without confirmation (immediate reset)

**Label State Machine Reset**: When workspace is started (via `trigger_start` or `trigger_force_start`), the `reset_github_labels` Tauri command automatically resets the GitHub label state machine:
- Removes `loom:in-progress` from all open issues (workers can reclaim them)
- Replaces `loom:reviewing` with `loom:review-requested` on all open PRs (reviewer can re-review)
- This ensures a clean state when restarting the workspace with fresh agent terminals

**Note**: When you first open the project, Claude Code will prompt you to approve these MCP servers. You can also enable them automatically by setting `"enableAllProjectMcpServers": true` in your `.claude/settings.local.json`.

## Subagents

The `agents/` directory contains Claude Code subagents that are automatically invoked based on task descriptions. Each subagent is specialized for a specific role in the Loom development workflow.

### Available Subagents

| Agent | Description | Tools | Model |
|-------|-------------|-------|-------|
| **builder** | Implements features for `loom:issue` issues and creates PRs | Full (Write, Edit, TodoWrite) | Sonnet |
| **judge** | Reviews PRs with `loom:review-requested` label | Read-only | Sonnet |
| **curator** | Enhances issues and marks them as `loom:curated` | Read-only | Sonnet |
| **architect** | Creates architectural proposals with `loom:architect` | Full (can write docs) | Opus |
| **hermit** | Identifies bloat and creates simplification issues | Read-only | Sonnet |
| **healer** | Addresses PR feedback and resolves conflicts | Full (fixes PRs) | Sonnet |
| **guide** | Triages issues and applies `loom:urgent` to top 3 | Read-only | Sonnet |
| **driver** | General shell environment for ad-hoc tasks | Full | Sonnet |

### How Subagents Work

**Automatic Invocation**: Claude Code automatically selects and invokes the appropriate subagent based on your task description. For example:
- "Review PR #123" → Invokes the **judge** subagent
- "Implement issue #456" → Invokes the **builder** subagent
- "Find unused dependencies" → Invokes the **hermit** subagent

**YAML Frontmatter**: Each subagent file has frontmatter defining:
- `name` - Agent identifier
- `description` - When Claude should invoke this agent (critical for auto-selection)
- `tools` - Allowed tools (restricts capabilities for safety)
- `model` - Which model to use (sonnet or opus)

**Tool Restrictions**:
- **Read-only agents** (judge, curator, hermit, guide): Can read code and create issues/comments but cannot modify files
- **Write-enabled agents** (builder, healer, architect, driver): Can modify files, create commits, and push changes

### Agent Roles in Workflow

The subagents work together following the label-based workflow:

1. **architect** scans codebase → creates proposals with `loom:architect`
2. **User approves** → adds `loom:issue` label
3. **curator** enhances issues → marks as `loom:curated`
4. **User approves** → adds `loom:issue` label
5. **guide** prioritizes → adds `loom:urgent` to top 3
6. **builder** implements → creates PR with `loom:review-requested`
7. **judge** reviews → approves or requests changes
8. **healer** fixes feedback → transitions back to `loom:review-requested`
9. **User merges** → issue auto-closes

### Creating Custom Subagents

To create a custom subagent:

1. Create `defaults/.claude/agents/your-agent.md`
2. Add YAML frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   name: your-agent
   description: Clear description of when to invoke this agent
   tools: Bash, Read, Grep, Glob, Task
   model: sonnet
   ---
   ```
3. Write agent instructions below frontmatter
4. Claude Code will automatically detect and use it

See the [Claude Code subagent documentation](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/agents) for more details.
