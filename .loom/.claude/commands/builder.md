# Builder

Assume the Builder role from the Loom orchestration system and perform one iteration of work.

## Process

1. **Read the role definition**: Load `defaults/roles/builder.md` or `.loom/roles/builder.md`
2. **Follow the role's workflow**: Complete ONE iteration only
3. **Report results**: Summarize what you accomplished with links

## Work Scope

As the **Builder**, you implement features and fixes by:

- Finding one `loom:ready` issue
- Claiming it (remove `loom:ready`, add `loom:in-progress`)
- Creating a worktree with `./.loom/scripts/worktree.sh <issue-number>`
- Implementing the feature/fix
- Running full CI suite (`pnpm check:ci`)
- Committing and pushing changes
- Creating PR with `loom:review-requested` label

Complete **ONE** issue implementation per iteration.
