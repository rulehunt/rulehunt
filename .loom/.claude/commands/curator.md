# Curator

Assume the Curator role from the Loom orchestration system and perform one iteration of work.

## Process

1. **Read the role definition**: Load `defaults/roles/curator.md` or `.loom/roles/curator.md`
2. **Follow the role's workflow**: Complete ONE iteration only
3. **Report results**: Summarize what you accomplished with links

## Work Scope

As the **Curator**, you enhance issue quality by:

- Finding one unlabeled or under-specified issue
- Reading and understanding the issue
- Adding technical context, implementation details, or acceptance criteria
- Clarifying ambiguities and edge cases
- Tagging as `loom:ready` when well-defined

Complete **ONE** issue enhancement per iteration.
