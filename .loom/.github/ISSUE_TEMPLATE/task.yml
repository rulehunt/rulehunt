        **Welcome to Loom Issue Tracker**

        **Important**: Loom uses GitHub Issues to control the AI-driven development process. Issues are actionable development tasks, not discussions.

        - **For questions, ideas, or feedback**: Use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/rjwalters/loom/discussions)
        - **For development tasks**: Use this template

        **External contributors**: Your issue will be automatically labeled as `external` and reviewed by maintainers. Our AI agents focus on internal workflow, so external issues require manual triage.
