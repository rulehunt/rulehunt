# `gh issue create` REST fallback (GraphQL rate-limit exhaustion)

`gh issue create` is a **GraphQL-backed mutation**. GitHub's GraphQL quota
(5000/hr, shared across every agent + tool) and its REST quota are
**independent** — the same fact `judge.md`'s "GraphQL Rate-Limit
Exhaustion — REST Fallback for Labels/Comments" section and #4856's
`forge_gh_comment_rl_safe` / `forge_gh_reopen_issue_rl_safe` /
`forge_gh_swap_label_rl_safe` already rely on for labels, comments, and
reopen. Before #5047, issue **creation** was the one filing mutation left
uncovered: every role prompt that files issues (architect, auditor,
builder-complexity, builder-pr, curator, doctor, hermit, hermit-patterns,
judge) died outright when GraphQL exhausted, even though the REST pool
typically sits nearly untouched (observed live: `core` 19/5000 used vs.
`graphql` 1378/5000 used).

This page is the **single source** for the fallback recipe — role prompts
link here rather than repeating it. If the recipe needs to change, change it
here (and in `forge_gh_create_issue_rl_safe` / `create-issue.sh`, its
executable equivalents), not in nine separate files.

## Use `./.loom/scripts/create-issue.sh`, never a bare `gh issue create` (#5077)

A role prompt can only teach an executable command, not a bash function
sourced from a library — so `./.loom/scripts/create-issue.sh` is the
canonical entry point every issue-filing role invokes directly:

```bash
./.loom/scripts/create-issue.sh \
  --title "Some title" \
  --body-file /tmp/issue-body.md \
  --label "loom:triage"
# prints the new issue's URL, exactly like `gh issue create`
```

Flags are a `gh issue create`-compatible subset — `--title/-t`, `--body/-b`,
`--body-file/-F`, repeatable (or comma-separated) `--label/-l`, `--repo/-R` —
chosen so an existing invocation transfers by changing only the command name.
It tries `gh issue create` first and, only on one of the five documented
rate-limit signatures below, retries the identical filing as a single REST
POST.

## The duplicate backstop (#7971): exit 3 means NOT FILED

Before filing, `create-issue.sh` runs the sibling `check-duplicate.sh` against
**open issues** and **exits 3 without creating anything** when it reports an
above-threshold match. The block message lists the matches and the `--force`
re-run:

```
create-issue.sh: NOT FILED -- this looks like a duplicate of open work:
  #4242: sweep-lease-fence.sh:392 repo_args unbound under bash 3.2 (similarity: 34%)
Nothing was created. Either:
  * comment on the issue above instead of filing a new one, or
  * re-run with --force if this is genuinely distinct work.
```

### No exit is silent (#8289)

`create-issue.sh` never returns "no URL and no text". Every refusal, warning
and fail-open reason goes to **stderr**; the URL alone goes to stdout. Three
paths that could previously exit with nothing at all were reproduced against a
stubbed forge and fixed in `forge_gh_create_issue_rl_safe`: a `gh issue create`
that fails with empty stderr (killed process), one that writes its error to
stdout instead, and one that exits **0** with no URL — the last of which used
to be reported to the caller as a successful filing.

**Why here and not in the role prompts.** Eight role prompts already teach a
`check-duplicate.sh` step — and they are the roles whose *primary job* is
filing issues (Architect, Hermit, Auditor, Curator, Guide), the ones most
likely to remember anyway. The roles that file issues as a **side effect** of
other work (Builder, Doctor, Judge) had the step in none of their prompts, and
that is the high-duplication path by construction: every concurrent Builder
trips over the same broken script and files reflexively. On 2026-09-16 three
Builders filed the same bug — #7957, #7960, #7968 — inside four minutes. A
backstop at the single filing call site covers every caller, including roles
nobody updates.

The prompt-level alternative was also *structurally* unavailable: every file
under `defaults/.claude/commands/loom/` is frozen at its current size by
`scripts/check-markdown-token-budget.sh`, so a paragraph added to `builder.md`
/ `doctor.md` / `judge.md` fails CI unless as much is deleted from the same
file. `builder-pr.md`, `builder-complexity.md`, `doctor.md` and `judge.md`
already link here from their issue-filing sites, so this page is where the
detail belongs — and the backstop itself needs no prompt text to work.

**It fails OPEN on everything inconclusive**, so it can never become a new way
for a filing to die:

| Situation | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `check-duplicate.sh` missing / non-executable / exits 2 | warn on stderr, **file anyway** |
| `NON_DISCRIMINATIVE` (#4409 — the scorer reporting it is not separating anything for this query) | warn, **file anyway** |
| The match is already cross-referenced by the filing (`Part of #123`) | **file anyway** — an intentional follow-up scores high against the work that spawned it; decomposition is not duplication |
| `--repo OWNER/REPO` given | check **skipped** — `check-duplicate.sh` searches the working directory's repo and cannot answer for another one |
| `--force` / `--skip-duplicate-check` / `LOOM_SKIP_DUPLICATE_CHECK=1` | check **skipped** |

**This does not make the REST fallback GraphQL-dependent.** Under GraphQL
exhaustion `check-duplicate.sh` falls back to REST itself, and a *total*
failure of it lands in the fail-open row above — the create still runs, still
falls back to the REST POST below, and still returns the new issue's URL. A
caller that already ran `check-duplicate.sh` for a whole burst (the eight
prompts above) should export `LOOM_SKIP_DUPLICATE_CHECK=1` rather than pay for
the same search twice per filing.

**Deliberate multi-filing bursts want the env skip, not `--force` per call.** A
decomposition or epic-phase burst files several issues that are similar *to each
other* by construction — `[Parent #812] Part 1` and `[Parent #812] Part 2` share
most of their keywords, so Part 2 can be blocked by the Part 1 filed seconds
earlier. (The parent itself never blocks a child: a child citing `#812`
anywhere in its title or body lands in the cross-reference row above.) Export
`LOOM_SKIP_DUPLICATE_CHECK=1` once for the burst rather than `--force`-ing each
call:

```bash
export LOOM_SKIP_DUPLICATE_CHECK=1   # this decomposition / phase burst only
```

This is the right move for `builder-complexity.md`'s decomposition loop,
`epic.md` Phase 5, and `champion-epic.md`'s phase-issue creation loop — each is
already deduplicated by the design step (or existence check) that precedes it.
Forgetting it is recoverable, not lossy: the block message names the match and
the `--force` re-run, and nothing was filed.

**Alerting callers pass `--force` deliberately.** `loom-daemon-watchdog.sh`'s
outage / peer-coordination escalations and `loom-daemon-start.sh`'s
unprovisionable-watchdog filing are each already deduplicated by their own
sentinel file, and a similarity heuristic must never be what silences an
outage alert — so those three call sites file with `--force`.

## The five-signature table

A rejection whose text contains one of these (case-insensitive) is a rate
limit, not a real failure — retry the same creation over REST instead of
giving up:

| Signature | Seen as |
|---|---|
| `api rate limit exceeded` | REST itself throttling (rare on the fallback path) |
| `api rate limit already exceeded` | GraphQL: `GraphQL: API rate limit already exceeded for user ID …` |
| `secondary rate limit` | either transport, burst throttling |
| `abuse detection mechanism` | either transport, burst throttling |
| `was submitted too quickly` | either transport, burst throttling |

Anything else — auth failure, network error, a validation error (e.g. a
nonexistent label) — is **not** a rate limit; report it and do not retry
over REST.

## The recipe: atomic create + label, never create-then-label

**Labels must be applied in the same request as creation**, on both the
primary and fallback paths. A create-then-label two-step doubles the request
count (worse under the exact quota pressure this fallback exists for) and
can half-fail, leaving an unlabeled issue behind.

```bash
# Primary path — unchanged, still tried first:
gh issue create --repo "$NWO" --title "$TITLE" --body "$BODY" --label "$LABEL"

# On a rate-limit rejection (see the signature table above), fall back to a
# REST POST with labels in the SAME payload. With no NWO, `repos/{owner}/{repo}`
# is a literal placeholder `gh api` expands from the git remote — zero extra
# API calls, unlike `gh repo view`, itself GraphQL-backed (#4659):
REST_PATH="repos/${NWO:-\{owner\}/\{repo\}}/issues"
jq -n --arg t "$TITLE" --arg b "$BODY" --arg l "$LABEL" \
  '{title: $t, body: $b, labels: [$l]}' | \
  gh api --method POST "$REST_PATH" --input - --jq '.html_url'
```

## Scripted callers: `forge_gh_create_issue_rl_safe`

`create-issue.sh` above is a thin CLI wrapper over this bash function in
`lib/forge-helpers.sh`; if you are already sourcing that library, call it
directly instead of shelling out:

```bash
source "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/lib/forge-helpers.sh"

# forge_gh_create_issue_rl_safe NWO TITLE BODY [LABEL...]
# NWO may be "" for "the repo of the current working directory".
url=$(forge_gh_create_issue_rl_safe "" "$TITLE" "$BODY" "loom:triage" "bug")
```

It tries `gh issue create` first, falls back to the REST POST above on a
rate-limit rejection (applying labels atomically either way), prints the
created issue's URL on success, and propagates any non-rate-limit failure
without attempting the REST call. GitHub-only, like the sibling `*_rl_safe`
helpers — gate calls on `FORGE_TYPE == github` the same way callers already
gate `forge_gh_comment_rl_safe` et al.

## `loom-daemon forge issue create` does NOT get this fallback

`loom-daemon forge issue <args…>` is a byte-identical passthrough to `gh
issue <args…>` (see `loom-daemon/src/forge_cmd.rs`'s `gh_passthrough`) — it
execs the real `gh` binary with the same arguments and inherits the same
GraphQL cost, with **no** REST-fallback interception for `issue create`
specifically (the passthrough is generic across every `gh issue` subcommand,
not create-aware). It is not a safe alternative to reach for under GraphQL
exhaustion — `forge issue create` prints a one-line stderr notice pointing
back here. Use `create-issue.sh` or the recipe above instead.

## Serialize issue creation, fallback or not

The REST fallback does not change the existing serialization requirement
(#3707): `gh issue create` (and its REST equivalent) returns a
server-assigned number with no client-side coordination, so concurrent
issue-filing agents in the same repo still race on issue numbers and can
cross-contaminate bodies. One issue-creating agent finishes its entire
filing burst — REST fallback included — before the next starts.
