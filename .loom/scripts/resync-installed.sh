# resync-installed.sh - Refresh installed Loom surfaces from the recorded source (#3777, #4239).
#
# The installed Loom surfaces the harness actually executes/reads are copied from
# the Loom source repo's defaults/ tree at install time. After a `git pull` that
# merges a fix to those files, the INSTALLED copies are NOT automatically updated
# — so a repo can run stale hooks/scripts/roles/docs/commands indefinitely (see
# #3777: the guard-precision trio #3755/#3756/#3757 merged to main, but the
# installed guard-destructive.sh kept its pre-fix behavior until hand-copied).
#
# This is the REMEDIATION half of the drift problem. #3770
# (check-main-freshness.sh) DETECTS the drift with a warning; this script FIXES
# it. The intended flow is: "freshness warning says you're stale -> run resync."
#
# PRECONDITION (#6202): that flow only works when a defaults/ SOURCE tree can
# be resolved (see resolve_defaults() below) — this checkout IS the Loom
# source repo, OR the gitignored `.loom/loom-source-path` sidecar points at a
# local clone of it. Neither holds on a checkout that never ran the Loom
# installer locally (a fresh developer clone, a CI checkout, a machine that
# received the repo rather than installing into it) — the exact population
# most likely to be running stale surfaces, since they never ran the
# installer that would have refreshed them. On that population this script
# fails on first use with "Could not locate a defaults/ source tree to sync
# from"; check-main-freshness.sh now detects the same gap and says so before
# you get here (see its own #6202 note), but if you landed on this file
# directly: clone https://github.com/rjwalters/loom locally, then either
# re-run its installer against this repo or write the sidecar yourself
# (`echo /path/to/local/loom-clone > .loom/loom-source-path`).
#
# It is idempotent (a no-op when already in sync), reports per-file
# updated/created/removed/unchanged/skipped, only ever touches files that
# either exist in the source tree or are explicitly declared retired (see
# "RETIRED PAYLOAD FILES" below) — repo-specific files with no source
# counterpart and no retirement entry are left alone — never clobbers a
# symlinked install target, and supports --dry-run.
#
# Surfaces resynced (#4239 widened this from hooks+scripts to the full pure-copy

# It also applies one targeted field edit outside the pure-copy model (#4285):
# a root package.json whose "name" is exactly "loom-workspace" (the Loom
# installer's workspace-scaffolding stub, `defaults/package.json`) has its
# decoy "version" field deleted in place if present — this is a `jq
# 'del(.version)'` field edit, NOT a whole-file resync, so a consumer's
# customized "scripts" block in the stub is preserved. A consumer's OWN
# package.json (any other "name") is never touched.
#
# On a successful non-dry-run it also re-stamps loom_version, loom_commit, and a
# last_resync date into .loom/install-metadata.json (requires jq or python3;
# skipped with a warning if neither is present — the file sync still succeeds).
# It also ensures a `merge=ours` driver is wired up for that same file (#4528)
# — a machine-local stamp every host re-writes, guaranteeing merge conflicts
# between hosts otherwise — via a Loom-managed .gitattributes block plus local
# git config (never committed; runs every time so a pre-#4528 install
# self-heals on its next resync).
#
# It also refreshes the marker-delimited Loom-managed `.gitignore` block via the
# daemon's `update-gitignore` subcommand (#4280) — the ephemeral-pattern list is
# single-sourced in loom-daemon, so existing installs converge on newly-ignored
# runtime paths (e.g. .loom/sweep-checkpoint/, .loom/worktrees-local/) at resync
# time. A missing daemon binary is a loud warning, not a silent skip. Any path
# still untracked-and-unignored under .loom/ afterward is reported as an audit
# warning so the pattern list can be extended.
#
# In the loom source repo itself (tracked installed surfaces + a local
# defaults/ tree), a non-dry-run that updates a file leaves the tree dirty
# until that resync output is committed. If the only remaining dirt is resync
# output, the summary block prints the exact `git add … && git commit`
# command to run (#4332) — worth doing, since `main_health_gate.rs`'s
# dirty-tree check treats byte-identical installed-surface dirt as ignorable
# (never a reason to skip the gate) but does not commit on the operator's
# behalf. Running this script here — including at a clean checkout pinned to
# origin/main — is supported and expected, not a bug: `.loom/` in this repo is
# a periodically-resynced snapshot of `defaults/`, not a live mirror, so any
# `defaults/`-only merge that lands after the last "chore: resync installed
# Loom surfaces" commit reintroduces drift that is real, deterministic, and
# bounded only by how long it has been since that last resync commit (#5510).
#
# ATOMIC WRITES + DEFERRED SELF-UPDATE (#4669): every file is installed by
# staging a copy NEXT TO its destination and rename(2)-ing it into place, never
# by truncating and rewriting the destination in place. This matters most for
# THIS script: resync-installed.sh is itself a file under defaults/scripts/, so
# a resync copies it over the very path the running bash process is still
# reading from. The old in-place `cp` let bash resume reading a half-rewritten
# file at a now-meaningless byte offset — the reported `syntax error near
# unexpected token` mid-run, which aborted the run and left dozens of surfaces
# partially refreshed. A rename swaps the directory entry and leaves the
# already-open inode intact, so the running process keeps reading the exact
# bytes it started with. Belt-and-suspenders, the self-copy is also DEFERRED:
# it is applied only after every other surface has settled.
#
# A file that cannot be staged or renamed is counted as a FAILURE: the run
# still finishes the remaining files, then prints an explicit PARTIAL summary
# naming every failed path and exits 1. No file is ever left half-written
# (staging happens off to the side), so re-running after fixing the cause
# completes the refresh — a partial refresh is never silent.
#
# CRASH-DETECTION MARKER (#5980): #4669 above protects individual files from
# being torn mid-write, but it does not protect the RUN as a whole from dying
# outright — e.g. hitting a bug in the OLD installed copy of this script
# (before the fixed copy has been synced in) aborts bash entirely, with an
# arbitrary number of surfaces already refreshed and the rest still stale.
# Before #5980, nothing recorded that a run was ever in progress, so a
# crashed run left the working tree silently half-updated while
# .loom/install-metadata.json kept reporting the OLD loom_version — the
# install looked simply "never updated" rather than "partially updated".
#
# `.loom/.resync-in-progress` (gitignored) closes that gap: it is written with
# the target version BEFORE any surface is touched (non-dry-run only) and
# removed only once the run reaches a full, non-partial success. On EVERY
# invocation (including --dry-run, so it doubles as a zero-side-effect
# detector) a leftover marker from a prior run is reported as a loud WARN
# naming the target version and start time it never finished. No separate
# "resume from where it left off" bookkeeping is needed: the whole script is
# already idempotent (see above), so a fresh restart after a crash converges
# on exactly the state a completed run would have reached — files the crashed
# run already finished are simply re-verified as unchanged, not re-copied.
#
# Not done here (left as a follow-up, #5980): inverting the self-update order
# so the script resyncs ITSELF and re-execs into the fixed copy before
# touching any other surface, which would keep a buggy OLD script off the
# critical path entirely instead of only detecting after the fact that it ran
# into one. The marker is the tractable, low-risk half of the fix; the
# reordering is a larger, riskier restructuring of the self-update deferral
# #4669 established.

# WORKTREE RESTRICTION (#4563): the installed .loom/ is ALWAYS resolved against
# the PRIMARY worktree (via `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`), so running this
# from a linked worktree — an issue/PR worktree under .loom/worktrees/ — writes
# to the MAIN checkout, not to the worktree you are standing in. A Builder that
# does so contaminates main mid-sweep (the 2026-07-30 incident: four installed
# paths written into main from a wave-2 builder's worktree and quarantined by
# check-main-clean.sh). The script therefore REFUSES to run when its own
# `--show-toplevel` differs from the resolved main-checkout root, and exits 1.
# Installed-copy propagation is the periodic resync commit's job: land the
# defaults/ change, then resync from the main checkout. An operator who really
# does mean "write the main checkout's installed copies from here" can pass
# --allow-worktree (or export LOOM_RESYNC_ALLOW_WORKTREE=1). Running from the
# main checkout itself — including any subdirectory of it — is unaffected.
#
# STAGING MODE (#6106): --allow-worktree (or a bare re-run from the main
# checkout) is unsafe while the fleet is live — the daemon may be dispatching
# sweeps in that same checkout, so writing dozens of installed files there
# mid-sweep risks exactly the contamination this whole restriction exists to
# prevent. --output <dir> is the safe alternative: it creates a disposable,
# DETACHED `git worktree` at HEAD under <dir> (never inside .loom/worktrees/,
# and never touching the primary checkout's own files) and resyncs INTO that
# staging worktree instead of REPO_ROOT — so it can be run from anywhere
# (primary checkout or any linked worktree) at any time, including mid-sweep,
# with zero risk to the live checkout. The staging worktree is a real,
# independent git checkout: once the sync is complete you `cd` into it,
# `git add -A && git commit` (and `git push` / open a PR) from there, then
# `git worktree remove` it. See "OUTPUT-DIR STAGING MODE" further below for
# the full mechanics. --dry-run + --output still creates (and then
# auto-removes) the staging worktree, so a preview never leaves any residue.
#
# Local-override convention: list a relative path (e.g. `hooks/guard-destructive.sh`,
# `scripts/foo.sh`, `roles/custom-role.md`, `docs/notes.md`, `bin/loom`,
# `commands/loom/mine.md`, `package.json` to pin the #4285 stub version edit,
# `.loom/CLAUDE.md` to pin the #5559 version-header restamp, or `CLAUDE.md` to
# pin the #6612 root version-header restamp) — one per line — in
# `.loom/resync-ignore` to pin an intentional per-repo customization. Matching
# files are reported as `skipped` and never overwritten. Blank lines and `#`
# comments are ignored.
#
# Path form (#6515): entries may be written either ".loom/"-relative (the form
# above, e.g. `scripts/foo.sh`) OR the more natural repo-relative spelling
# (e.g. `.loom/scripts/foo.sh`, optionally with a leading `./`) — is_ignored()
# tries the exact string first, then retries with a leading `./` and `.loom/`
# stripped, so both spellings pin the same file. An entry that still matches
# NEITHER form (a typo, or a pin for a file upstream has since retired) is a
# silent no-op no longer: every run ends with a `pin had no effect: '<entry>'`
# warning for each dead entry, naming the closest walked path when one shares
# its basename.
#
# RETIRED PAYLOAD FILES (#5981): the walk above only ever visits files that
# CURRENTLY exist under defaults/, so a file retired upstream (deleted from
# defaults/ entirely, e.g. defaults/scripts/status.sh in #5710) has no
# source to walk from and is therefore never noticed, let alone removed —
# it survives indefinitely in every already-installed repo. `defaults/.loom-retired.list`
# is the declarative fix: one target-relative path per line (same
# report-relative form as the per-file report and `.loom/resync-ignore`,
# e.g. `scripts/status.sh`), naming a file that WAS Loom payload and has
# since been deleted from defaults/. Every run, `remove_retired_files()`
# removes each listed path that is still present in the installed tree,
# reporting it with the `removed` verb — honoring the same `.loom/resync-ignore`
# pin and destination-symlink guard the update path uses, so a consumer who
# deliberately kept a fork of a retired file is never touched. A file with
# no retirement entry and no source counterpart is untouched, exactly as
# before — this is additive, not a general directory diff, so it can never
# guess-delete an unrelated repo-specific file.
#
# OUTPUT-DIR STAGING MODE (#6106): --output <dir> resyncs into an isolated
# location instead of the primary checkout, so a COMPLETE resync can be
# generated on demand — including while the fleet is live and mid-sweep —
# without the "run it from the main checkout" remedy the #4563 refusal above
# normally prescribes (which is unsafe precisely when the daemon is actively
# dispatching sweeps there). Mechanics:
#   1. <dir> must not already exist. It is created via
#      `git worktree add --detach <dir> HEAD` against the PRIMARY checkout's
#      repository — a real, independent git checkout at the primary's current
#      HEAD, registered as a linked worktree but living wherever the caller
#      pointed <dir> (never inside .loom/worktrees/, so it can never collide
#      with worktree.sh's bookkeeping). Creating it only touches git's
#      worktree-registry metadata (.git/worktrees/) — it does not read, write,
#      or lock any file in the primary checkout's own working tree.
#   2. Every destination this script would otherwise resolve under the
#      primary checkout (.loom/hooks, .loom/scripts, .loom/roles, .loom/docs,
#      .loom/runtimes, .loom/bin, .claude/commands/loom, the single-file docs,
#      install-metadata.json, .loom/CLAUDE.md, package.json, .gitattributes,
#      .gitignore) is instead resolved under <dir>. defaults/ itself (the
#      SOURCE of the sync) is still read from the primary checkout — that is
#      a read, never a write, so it carries none of the #4563 hazard.
#   3. On success the run prints the exact `cd <dir> && git add -A && git
#      commit ... && git push` sequence to turn the staged tree into a
#      resync commit (and PR) from a location that was never live-mid-sweep,
#      plus the `git worktree remove` to clean up afterward.
# Because step 1 creates a real worktree, the #4563 linked-worktree refusal
# itself never applies when --output is given — there is nothing left for it
# to protect, since nothing is written to the primary checkout either way.
# --dry-run + --output still creates the staging worktree (needed as the
# preview's target) but auto-removes it before exiting, since a preview must
# leave no residue.
#
# The SAME `.loom/resync-ignore` list is read by the installer (issue #5971) as

# LOCAL-DIVERGENCE PROTECTION (#7864): sync_one() no longer overwrites an
# installed file unconditionally. When an update would REMOVE at least one
# non-blank line that exists in the installed copy but not in the new
# defaults/ source, AND the installed file's most recent commit was NOT
# routine install/resync tooling output (`chore: install Loom vX.Y.Z` or
# `chore: resync installed Loom surfaces`, i.e. someone patched the INSTALLED
# copy directly since the last install/resync), the file is left untouched
# and reported as "blocked" instead of silently reverting the local fix. A
# run with any blocked file exits 1 (real apply) or 2 (--dry-run, alongside
# ordinary drift). Re-run with --force once you've reviewed the diff and
# confirmed the removal is intentional (e.g. the fix landed upstream too) to
# apply it anyway. A file with no git history has nothing to protect and is
# never blocked; a pure-addition update (nothing removed) is never blocked
# either — this only gates the specific shape of the incident that motivated
# it (a resync silently reverting a merged, tested hook fix with no diff
# review — first hit and fixed downstream at `2AMLogic/sky130-modexp`#117,
# ported here per `2AMLogic/2am`#869).

#   1. Loom source repo (dogfood): $REPO_ROOT/defaults/
#   2. Recorded loom-source-path (target repo install)
#   3. install-metadata.json "loom_source"
#
# SOURCE_ROOT is the parent of DEFAULTS_DIR (always <root>/defaults) and is used
# to read the current loom_version (package.json) + loom_commit (git HEAD) for
# the metadata re-stamp.
#
# #5624: none of the current writers (install.sh, scripts/install-loom.sh,
# loom-daemon's write_install_metadata) put "loom_source" into
# install-metadata.json anymore — that field leaked the installing machine's
# absolute path (including username) into a committed file. Priority 3 below
# is therefore now a read-only compatibility path: it only helps a repo that
# already committed the field before this fix AND whose gitignored
# `.loom/loom-source-path` sidecar (priority 2) has since gone missing on the
# same machine. It cannot fire at all for a post-fix install. This is an
# accepted, intentional narrowing of the recovery path (Acceptance Criteria,
# #5624) — no replacement fallback is added.

# A candidate source root is only usable if it actually has SOMETHING to sync
# from — `-d "$root/defaults"` alone is not sufficient (#6780): a sidecar or
# metadata path can point at a directory that still exists (unlike the
# "vanished clone" case, which already fails loud below) but is stale, empty,
# or was never a real Loom checkout — e.g. a scratch clone whose contents were
# emptied without removing the directory itself, or an unrelated directory
# that merely happens to contain an empty `defaults/`. Requiring a populated
# `defaults/hooks` or `defaults/scripts` mirrors the dogfood rung's own check
# immediately below and closes the gap that let resolve_defaults() "succeed"
# against a source tree with nothing under it — which then made the sync walk
# below iterate zero files and report "already in sync", a false "current"

# ---------- local-divergence protection (#7864) ----------
#
# sync_one() used to overwrite an installed file unconditionally whenever it
# differed from defaults/, with no diff review and no way to tell "upstream
# moved forward" from "upstream's defaults/ has not caught up with a fix that
# landed directly on the INSTALLED copy". A resync in that second state
# silently reverted two merged, tested guard-hook fixes this way at
# `2AMLogic/sky130-modexp` (its #98, #100) — see that repo's PR #117 for the
# incident this protects against.
#
# The gate only fires when BOTH are true:
#   1. the update would REMOVE at least one non-blank line that exists in the
#      installed copy but not in the new source — a pure-addition update
#      (nothing removed) is the overwhelmingly common shape of a routine
#      upstream improvement and is never gated; and
#   2. the installed file's own git history shows its most recent change was
#      NOT a routine install/resync commit. Recognize the current installer
#      subject (with optional "[skip ci]"), legacy install and resync subjects.
#      Any other last touch means the installed content has diverged
#      since the last time Loom's own tooling touched it, exactly the
#      #98/#100 shape. A file whose last touch WAS one of those (or that has
#      no git history at all — nothing to protect) is never gated, regardless
#      of how much content changes: that is ordinary upstream evolution, and
#      gating it would defeat the automation this script exists for.
#
# This intentionally does not require a diff-free match to some remembered
# "last synced" state (no such provenance is tracked anywhere today) — it
# only asks "would this specific write destroy content that was NOT put there
# by Loom's own install/resync tooling", which is exactly the condition the
# incident hinged on.
#
# #8098: the legacy `chore: install Loom v[0-9]` alternative below is anchored
# with the same "optional squash suffix, then end of subject" ending
# (`[^[:space:]]*( \(#[0-9]+\))?$`) as its two siblings. It used to be a bare,
# unanchored prefix match, so a commit subject that merely STARTED with
# "chore: install Loom v" but then said something else entirely — e.g.
# "chore: install Loom v1 and also revert the guard fix" — was misclassified
# as routine install/resync lineage (ROUTINE, silently overwritten) instead of
# a diverged local commit (DIVERGED, protected). Low practical risk (the
# legacy subject is not produced by any current installer path — see
# `chore(loom): Install Loom ... orchestration framework` below for that), but
# a real anchoring bug: an installed file's genuinely-last commit is normally
# provided verbatim by `git log`, not hand-typed, but nothing prevented a
# hand-amended or hand-rebased subject from taking this exact shape.

#   LC_ALL=C on the `comm` itself is load-bearing, not decoration (#8165):
#   GNU comm validates that its inputs are sorted *in the current locale's

#   ambient locale, comm re-reads a C-sorted stream under (say) en_US.UTF-8
#   collation, declares it "not in sorted order", and then emits a garbage
#   line set -- over-counting (a spurious BLOCK on a pure-addition update,
#   recoverable only with --force) or under-counting (a silent fail-open
#   back to the pre-#7864 revert-the-local-fix behaviour), depending on the
#   content. Pinning the comparison to the same collation its inputs were
#   sorted in makes the count locale-invariant.

# ---------- content-based lineage proof (#8676) ----------
#
# The subject heuristic above answers "who last TOUCHED this file", which is
# only a proxy for the question that actually matters: "is this installed
# content something Loom's own tooling put here, or a local fix?". The proxy
# is wrong for every file that has not been touched since the repo's ORIGINAL
# install, because that install's commit subject is whatever the installing
# human typed. Real fleet examples, none of which match any alternative above:
#
#     tooling: install Repo Skills and Loom into the map repo
#     Upgrade Loom to 0.18.0 (resync installed surfaces + role prompts)
#     Install Loom orchestration (quick install from rjwalters/loom@cd4ab46e)
#
# So the first time upstream EDITED such a file, the old upstream text being
# replaced was read as "lines unique to the installed copy" and the update was
# blocked as a phantom local fix. #8676's incident: commit 25fbc1bb3 renamed
# the jq variable `end` to `range_end` in scripts/archive-transcripts.sh for jq
# 1.6 compatibility, and every repo on an older install reported that legitimate
# fix blocked, each needing a hand-run --force. (Named without the `--arg` flag
# prefix on purpose: test-jq-reserved-word-args.sh is a repo-wide `git grep` for
# that literal shape in `*.sh` and cannot tell a comment from a live binding.)
#
# Decide by CONTENT first. If the installed file is byte-identical to its
# source counterpart as that stood at the version this repo currently has
# installed, then every byte of it came from a known upstream release and
# there is no local fix to protect — whatever the last commit's subject says.
# The installed version comes from .loom/install-metadata.json (loom_commit,
# re-stamped by restamp_metadata() on every successful resync, else a
# v<loom_version> tag) resolved in SOURCE_ROOT, the source checkout
# resolve_defaults() already located.
#
# That exact-version comparison alone is not enough, because the RECORDED
# version drifts ahead of the installed bytes: restamp_metadata() rewrites
# loom_commit to the source HEAD on every non-dry run and runs BEFORE the
# blocked-file exit, so the very run that blocks a file also records a version
# whose content that file no longer matches. So the content proof accepts any
# revision of that path reachable from the recorded version, not just the
# recorded one — see dst_matches_any_ancestor_of_lineage_ref() below.
#
# This is strictly a NARROWING of the gate: it can only ever turn a BLOCK into
# an update, never the reverse, and only on positive proof of pure upstream
# lineage. Anything that makes the proof unobtainable — SOURCE_ROOT is not a
# git checkout (tarball / vendored source), the recorded commit is absent from
# it (never fetched, GC'd, shallow clone), no matching tag, missing or
# "unknown" metadata, an unresolvable source path — falls straight through to
# the subject heuristic and behaves exactly as it did before #8676. None of
# Loom's installers clone shallowly today (`scripts/install-loom.sh` and
# `install.sh` both do a full clone), so on a normal fleet host the recorded
# short sha resolves and this fallback is the exception rather than the rule.
#
# The one local edit this cannot tell from upstream content is a deliberate
# REVERT of an installed file to an older upstream revision of itself. That is
# accepted: #7864 protects hand-written fixes that upstream does not have, and
# resync's whole contract is to carry an installed surface forward to the
# current release, so pinning an older upstream revision through this guard was
# never the supported mechanism (.loom/resync-ignore is, and still
# short-circuits ahead of this gate entirely).
#
# Deliberately NOT paired with a widened RESYNC_COMMIT_SUBJECT_RE. Teaching the
# regex the hand-typed subjects above would mean matching free-form prose,
# which is the misclassification #8098 removed; worse, it points the wrong way
# — a subject like "Upgrade Loom to 0.18.0 (...)" that ALSO carried a hand fix
# would become "routine" and be silently overwritten, the exact #7864 failure.
# The one forward-looking half of that idea is already true: the only installer
# path that commits installed surfaces (scripts/install/create-pr.sh) emits
# `chore(loom): Install Loom <v> orchestration framework`, which the regex
# already matches. Historical hand-typed subjects are what this content check
# is for, and it handles them without weakening anything.

# ---------- canonical Repo Skills guard detection (#4041, #4894, #5916, #5974) ----------
#
# When the canonical generic guard is installed in this repo AND passes ALL
# FOUR runtime probes the guard-destructive.sh dispatcher requires — the
# rjwalters/repo#29 VERSION marker, the `worktree-write-confinement`
# CAPABILITY marker (proving it actually implements the Loom-only Bash-tool
# write-confinement category, issue #4178, not just the unrelated repo#29 fix),
# the `--comment|--search` / `--arg|--argjson` CAPABILITY markers (proving
# it actually masks `gh --search`/`jq --arg`/`--argjson` quoted values before
# the catastrophic/ask scans, issue #5916, not just the unrelated
# version/write-confinement fixes), and the `gh-comment-body-literal-at`
# CAPABILITY marker (proving it actually carries the `--body @path`
# literal-string hard deny, issue #4523/#5974, not just the unrelated
# version/write-confinement/search-mask fixes) — Loom's vendored generic guard
# (guard-destructive-generic.sh) is intentionally NOT installed — the
# guard-destructive.sh dispatcher defers to the canonical guard at runtime.
# Resync must therefore neither resurrect the vendored copy nor leave a stale
# one behind. Same four-probe check the dispatcher/installer use, so all
# four agree on which guard wins (#4894: requiring only the version probe
# here would strip the vendored fallback out from under the dispatcher the
# moment a canonical guard picked up repo#29 without write-confinement,
# leaving zero coverage instead of the intended fallback; #5916 closes the
# same class of gap for the search/jq masking capability; #5974 closes it
# again for the --body @path hard-deny capability — see
# defaults/hooks/guard-destructive.sh's header comment for why a single
# `gh-comment-body-literal-at` marker is an adequate proxy for that whole
# rule family rather than a probe per decision-tag).
#
# Guard against #4403: the canonical Repo Skills guard is a LOCAL, typically
# gitignored, per-host install (`.claude/skills/repo/`), but the vendored guard
# it defers to (`.loom/hooks/guard-destructive-generic.sh`) can be git-tracked in
# a repo that commits `.loom/` (this repo dogfoods that layout). Removing a
# tracked file based purely on one contributor's local skill install deletes a
# repo-shared file for everyone else. So below, before removing the vendored
# guard, we check whether the target is git-tracked and skip the removal if so —
# only untracked (the normal consumer-repo) targets are removed.
#
# #4566: that skip is reported as an informational `note`, NOT a `warn`. The
# condition is a *steady state*, not an anomaly: it can only arise where a
# maintainer deliberately committed the vendored fallback (posture (a) — keep the
# tracked copy so contributors/CI without Repo Skills still get full generic-guard
# coverage; see defaults/docs/guard-hooks.md). Resync already takes the only
# correct action automatically, every run, forever — so an alarm-level line that
# reprints on every resync with no way to acknowledge it is pure noise. A repo
# that genuinely wants posture (b) drops the vendored copy deliberately with
# `git rm .loom/hooks/guard-destructive-generic.sh`, after which this branch stops
# firing entirely.

#
# Both `.loom/CLAUDE.md` (the full vendored guide, generated ONCE at install
# time by `loom-daemon init`) and root `CLAUDE.md` (the repo-customized
# operating core) used to carry a `**Loom Version**: X.Y.Z` header that this
# script re-stamped to the source version on every run — #5559 and #6612
# respectively, because nothing else kept them from drifting away from
# .loom/install-metadata.json's loom_version.
#
# #8147 removed the stamp itself instead: both files are injected into every
# agent session's prompt prefix, prompt-cache lookups match the whole prefix up
# to a content-block boundary, and so a single changed byte in either file
# invalidates every cached byte downstream of it — the full role prompt
# included — for every account, on every pulled bump. A header this script
# re-stamped per resync is exactly that kind of per-release mutable token.
#
# What is left is the one-time migration for repos installed BEFORE #8147:
# delete the leftover header line. After that the file no longer matches and
# this becomes a no-op forever, so an already-migrated (or freshly installed)
# guide is left byte-identical — which is the whole point. `.loom/install-
# metadata.json`'s loom_version (restamp_metadata() below) remains the single
# authoritative, non-prefix-injected record of the installed version.
#
# Only the version line is removed. The "**Installation Date**" header and any
# "Last updated:" footer are deliberately left alone — the former records the
# ORIGINAL install date, and re-stamping the latter would reintroduce a
# per-resync mutable token in a prefix-injected file, which is the very thing

# ---------- refresh the Loom-managed .gitignore block (#4280) ----------
#
# The marker-delimited managed block in the consumer's .gitignore is written by
# `loom-daemon init` at install time and was NEVER refreshed by resync — so a
# repo installed by a stale binary (or before a pattern was added) keeps ignoring
# the old set forever, leaving newer runtime dirs (e.g. .loom/sweep-checkpoint/,
# .loom/worktrees-local/) untracked-and-unignored. The ephemeral-pattern list is
# single-sourced in the daemon (EPHEMERAL_PATTERNS), so we invoke the daemon's
# `update-gitignore` subcommand rather than duplicating the list in shell. A
# missing/too-old binary is a LOUD stderr warning, never a silent skip.

# ---------- ensure the install-metadata.json merge=ours driver (#4528) ----------
#
# .loom/install-metadata.json is a machine-local install stamp: every host's
# resync (the restamp_metadata step above) re-writes loom_version,
# loom_commit, and last_resync (plus loom_source, an absolute host-specific
# path) on every run. Because the file must stay tracked (it is the
# authoritative ownership manifest consumed by verify-install.sh and
# uninstall-loom.sh — see is_untracked_runtime_file() in verify-install.sh,
# which already treats its exact byte content as non-checksum-tracked
# runtime state), any two hosts that each commit a resync and then
# `git merge`/`git pull` the other's commit collide on this file, every
# time, on the exact same lines.
#
# The fix: a `merge=ours` attribute for the path in a Loom-managed marker
# block in .gitattributes (committed, shared) plus the `ours` driver enabled
# in LOCAL (never committed) git config -- `git config merge.ours.driver
# true` -- which git-attributes(5) requires a `merge=ours` attribute to be
# paired with. This is safe because the file is fully re-derived by the
# next resync regardless of which side "wins" a given merge conflict.
#
# Runs on every resync (including a fresh, non-dry-run first run on an
# existing install predating this fix) so existing hosts self-heal the
# first time they resync after upgrading past #4528, with no separate
# migration step required.

# ---------- audit: untracked-and-unignored paths under .loom/ (#4280, #5983) ----------
#
# After the block refresh, anything STILL surfacing as untracked-and-unignored
# under .loom/ needs a remedy -- but which remedy depends on what the path IS.
# A path under a pure-copy surface (.loom/hooks|scripts|roles|docs|runtimes|bin/)
# that still exists under the corresponding defaults/ subdirectory today is
# shipped payload: it arrived via resync from defaults/, so the fix is simply
# to commit it. A path matching that same pure-copy-surface *pattern* but with
# no defaults/ counterpart today is presumed retired -- removed from defaults/
# without ever being added to defaults/.loom-retired.list (#5981), so
# remove_retired_files() never got a chance to clean it up before this audit
# ran -- and committing it would permanently ship dead code into the consumer's
# tree (#6613). Anything outside the pure-copy-surface pattern entirely is
# presumed genuine Loom runtime state the EPHEMERAL_PATTERNS list does not yet
# cover (an enumerated list always trails reality) -- surface it as a warning
# so it can be added there, instead of silently dirtying the consumer's `git
# status` (or being swept into a commit by `git add -A`). `git status
# --porcelain` already excludes ignored files, so every `??` entry here is by
# definition untracked-and-unignored; tracked install-owned files never
# appear, and a path already shadowed by an overbroad gitignore pattern (the
# installer's separate OVERBROAD_LOOM_PATTERNS hard-fail,
# loom-daemon/src/init/post_init.rs) is ignored rather than untracked, so
# `git status` excludes it here too -- it is never double-reported.

# ---------- guard-hook install check (#7761) ----------
#
# The per-file sync above already `chmod +x`es every hook it writes, so a lost
# executable bit self-heals HERE -- but only for hooks this run actually
# touched, and only reactively. Nothing verified the end state: that every hook
# the repo's .claude/settings.json WIRES is present and runnable. That gap is
# what made a missing/non-executable guard invisible until the moment a guard
# was needed and silently absent (#7761; the installed-guard surface drifting
# from defaults/hooks/ is a demonstrated failure mode -- #7416, #7423).
#
# Read-only by default, and best-effort like every other post-sync check: a
# broken guard install is reported (and carried into the exit code via
# GUARD_CHECK_BROKEN below), never a reason to abort a resync that has already
# fully applied. On a real (non---dry-run) resync it first tries --fix, which
# only ever restores an executable bit on a file that is already present.
#
# Dispatches onto whichever copy ended up installed at
# .loom/scripts/check-guards-installed.sh, falling back to the defaults/ source
# for the first run after upgrading past #7761 (when the installed copy is only
# being previewed, not yet on disk) -- the same resolution the label-drift check

# ---------- forge label drift check + safe auto-create (#6716) ----------
#
# .github/labels.yml is kept current by the scripts resync above, but nothing
# previously re-checked whether the TARGET FORGE REPO's LIVE label set still
# matched it after install -- a repo can drift silently forever (kicad-tools
# was missing 3 loom:operator* labels, corrupting a downstream operator
# census tool's bucketing, #6716). sync-labels.sh's --check mode (added
# alongside this) is read-only: it reports every declared label that is
# MISSING or STALE (present, wrong color/description), plus any UNKNOWN
# EXTRA -- a live loom:-prefixed label absent from labels.yml, reported but
# NEVER deleted. When drift is found on a real (non---dry-run) resync, this
# invokes the ALREADY-EXISTING mutating sync-labels.sh run to fix it --
# additive-only (no --prune-defaults passed), so nothing is ever deleted or
# renamed; it only creates what's missing and refreshes what's stale.
#
# Dispatches onto whichever sync-labels.sh ended up installed at
# .loom/scripts/sync-labels.sh by the "walk scripts" resync earlier in this
# run (not a hard-coded defaults/ path), so a repo that pins a customized
# copy via .loom/resync-ignore is checked against ITS OWN sync-labels.sh, not
# a bypassed one.
#
# Best-effort, like the .gitignore refresh above: any forge/lookup failure
# (no git remote, gh missing/unauthenticated, misconfigured Gitea) is a loud
# warning, never a script-aborting failure -- every other surface has already
# fully synced by the time this runs. A repo with no .github/labels.yml (or
# no sync-labels.sh to check with, even after the fallback below) is
# silently skipped -- nothing to check.
#
# Falls back to the SOURCE copy ($DEFAULTS_DIR/scripts/sync-labels.sh) when
# no installed copy exists yet (or it isn't executable) -- e.g. the very
# first --dry-run preview after upgrading past #6716 only PREVIEWS installing
# .loom/scripts/sync-labels.sh (see the "walk scripts" resync above), so it
# is not actually present on disk to invoke yet. WORKTREE_PATH is still
# pinned to $WRITE_ROOT either way (sync-labels.sh cd's into it before doing
# anything), so this fallback never points the check at the wrong repo's
# labels.yml -- only at a different (but functionally current) copy of the
# checking script itself.
