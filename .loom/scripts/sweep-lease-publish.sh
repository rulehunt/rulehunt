#!/usr/bin/env bash
# sweep-lease-publish.sh - Publish a lease record from an IN-SESSION
# `/loom:sweep` run (Issue #6320, Epic #6165).
#
# ## Why this exists
#
# Epic #6165 gives the `loom:building` claim a liveness dimension: a
# `<!-- loom:lease host=<host> sweep=<sweep-id> -->` marker comment whose
# forge-assigned `updated_at` is the freshness signal every host reads
# (`defaults/docs/lease-record.md`). Until this script, exactly ONE dispatch
# path ever wrote that record: `loom-daemon`'s
# `SweepRegistry::write_lease_comment`, called right after its own
# `flip_label_to_building` (#6179).
#
# An in-session `/loom:sweep` (an operator running `/loom:sweep N`, a
# `--no-daemon` run, a GH Actions cron invocation) dispatches its Builder
# through the Task tool one level deep -- there is no `SweepRegistry` entry
# and, before this script, no lease record either. That is a **hole exactly
# the shape of the in-session path**: a live in-session claim was
# indistinguishable from an abandoned one, so any daemon -- local or remote --
# consulting lease records to answer "is anyone still working this?" saw a
# bare `loom:building` label with no lease and reclaimed it. Observed
# consequence (#6320): a fleet-dispatch bot stripped a 9-minute-old in-session
# claim, re-claimed it, and dispatched a second Builder into the SAME
# `.loom/worktrees/issue-<N>` the first was still working in; the second ran
# `git reset --hard HEAD` and discarded the first's uncommitted edits.
#
# This script closes the writer-side hole: the in-session path publishes the
# same signal the daemon path does, in the same format, so both are read
# identically by every existing reader.
#
# ## What reads what this writes
#
#   - `loom-daemon`'s reclamation gate (#6286, Phase 2): a lease fresh within
#     `LOOM_LEASE_TTL_MINUTES` (default 15) REFUSES the reclaim of that
#     claim, whatever the host-scoped evidence concluded. This is the gate
#     that would have prevented #6320's data loss.
#   - `loom-daemon`'s dispatch-time claim-then-verify-order dedup (#6287,
#     Phase 2): a dispatcher that finds a peer's lease comment with an
#     EARLIER forge comment `id` inside its lookback window yields before
#     spawning a builder or touching a worktree. An in-session lease
#     published at pre-flight therefore makes a racing daemon dispatch stand
#     down rather than co-occupy the worktree.
#   - `sweep-lease-fence.sh check` (#6309, Phase 3): the sweep's own
#     pre-push/pre-PR fence.
#   - `sweep-lease-renew.sh` (#6180): keeps the record fresh for the sweep's
#     lifetime. **Pass this script's `--host`/`--sweep-id` through to
#     `renew-once`/`start`** so renewal targets THIS sweep's own lease
#     exactly, rather than "newest wins" -- otherwise a peer's later lease
#     comment would be the one this sweep keeps alive.
#
# ## Publish-at-pre-flight, not publish-at-claim
#
# The daemon writes its lease immediately AFTER flipping the label, because
# the daemon itself performs the flip. In-session, the label flip is done by
# the Builder subagent later, so the orchestrator publishes the lease at
# per-issue pre-flight -- the moment it decides this sweep will work `N`.
# That is deliberate and is the useful semantics: the question a reader asks
# is "is a live worker on this issue right now?", and the pre-flight instant
# is when that becomes true. It also puts the lease comment's `id` EARLIER
# than a racing daemon dispatch's, which is precisely what #6287's ordering
# check needs to make the daemon yield.
#
# ## Idempotency and peer safety
#
#   - A yielded host+sweep-id cannot be reused (exit 4). Start a new sweep
#     identity: fence and renewal readers permanently exclude yielded IDs.
#   - If THIS host+sweep-id already has a FRESH (within-TTL) lease comment on
#     the issue, this is a no-op (exit 0) -- a resumed sweep re-running
#     pre-flight never accumulates duplicate lease comments. This is
#     TTL-bounded, not unconditional: once that lease ages past the TTL, the
#     next pre-flight publishes a fresh duplicate rather than treating the
#     stale one as still covering this sweep.
#   - If a DIFFERENT host holds a lease that is still fresh, this script does
#     NOT publish (exit 4). Publishing would supersede a live peer's liveness
#     signal for every freshest-wins reader (`sweep-lease-fence.sh`,
#     `fetch_freshest_lease_updated_at`) and hand this sweep a claim a live
#     worker still holds. The caller should skip the issue.
#   - A stale (past-TTL) lease -- this host's or a peer's -- does not block
#     publication: it is exactly the abandoned-claim case a new lease should
#     supersede.
#
# ## Fail-open, like every other forge probe in this subsystem
#
# A `gh` read failure means "no evidence", never "a peer owns it": the script
# publishes anyway (a duplicate lease comment is harmless -- readers take the
# freshest). A `gh` WRITE failure exits 2 and the caller proceeds without a
# lease, exactly as it did before this script existed. This mirrors
# `write_lease_comment`'s fail-open contract (#6179) -- the `loom:building`
# label remains the authoritative claim; a lease only improves the evidence.
#
# ## Commands
#
#   sweep-lease-publish.sh publish <issue> [--host HOST] [--sweep-id ID]
#                                          [--ttl-minutes N]
#     Publish a lease record for <issue>. --host defaults to the PUBLISHED
#     form of this host's own identity (Issue #6322): the opaque id
#     (`opaque_host_id`, mirroring `sweep_registry::opaque_host_id` byte for
#     byte) of the raw identity `sweep_registry::host_identity()` resolves
#     (`LOOM_HOST_ID` > `$HOSTNAME` > the `hostname` binary > `unknown-host`)
#     -- unless `LOOM_LEASE_PUBLISH_HOSTNAME` opts into raw publishing, in
#     which case the raw identity is used directly. An explicit --host is
#     used verbatim (no transform applied). This is the same identity
#     `sweep-lease-fence.sh check`'s default `--host` resolves, so a publish
#     followed by an unqualified fence check on the same host always agrees
#     on which record is "this sweep's own" (#6333).
#     --sweep-id defaults to `$LOOM_SWEEP_RUN_ID`, else a generated
#     `sweep-insession-<UTC>-<pid>`; callers inside `/loom:sweep` should pass
#     their `$RUN_ID` (`sweep-run-registry.sh new`) so the lease, the run
#     registry, and the checkpoints all key on one identity. --ttl-minutes
#     defaults to `LOOM_LEASE_TTL_MINUTES` or 15 (Phase 2's default).
#
#     Exit codes:
#       0  Published, or a live lease for this host+sweep-id already exists.
#          Proceed.
#       1  Usage error (bad issue number, unknown flag, bad --ttl-minutes).
#       2  The publish `gh` call failed. Proceed WITHOUT a lease (best-effort).
#       4  A different host holds a fresh lease, or this identity yielded.
#          Nothing published. Skip this claim; a yielded ID needs a new run.
#
#     On exit 0 (published or already-held), the resolved identity is printed
#     to stdout as a single line: `<host> <sweep-id>` -- thread it into
#     `sweep-lease-renew.sh start <issue> --host <host> --sweep-id <id>`.
#
# Usage:
#   .loom/scripts/sweep-lease-publish.sh publish 6320
#   .loom/scripts/sweep-lease-publish.sh publish 6320 --sweep-id "$RUN_ID"
