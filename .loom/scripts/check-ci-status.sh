# check-ci-status.sh - Check CI status for the latest main branch commit
#
# Supports both GitHub and Gitea forges. Forge detection is automatic.
# - GitHub: uses Check Runs API + commit status API + Actions workflow-run API
# - Gitea: uses commit status API (mapped to check-run shape) + Actions
#   task-list API for workflow-run state
#
# A queued/in_progress workflow run with zero dispatched jobs has zero
# check-runs, so the workflow-run API call above is folded into the pending
# count independently of check-run counts -- otherwise other, unrelated,
# already-completed checks for the same commit could make this script report
# overall "success" before the primary CI workflow has run a single job
# (#5495).
#
# Usage:
#   ./check-ci-status.sh [--commit SHA] [--job "<name>"]
#
# Options:
#   --commit SHA  Check specific commit (default: HEAD)
#   --job NAME    Report only the named check-run's own status/conclusion
#                 (exact match against the check-run "name" field, e.g. the
#                 GitHub Actions job's `name:` -- "loom-worker Image Smoke
#                 Test" for the worker-image-smoke job) instead of the
#                 aggregate CI status across every check. Useful when a host
#                 cannot run a docker-dependent CI leg itself (#5748) and
#                 needs that specific job's real forge-reported outcome.
#   --json        Output results as JSON
#   --quiet       Only output status (see below)
#   --help        Show this help message
#
# Exit Codes (aggregate mode, default):
#   0 - CI passed (all checks successful)
#   1 - CI failed (at least one check failed)
#   2 - CI pending (checks still running)
#   3 - Unknown state or error
#
# Exit Codes (--job mode):
#   0 - the named job completed with a success conclusion
#   1 - the named job completed with a failure conclusion
#   2 - the named job is queued/in_progress (not yet completed)
#   3 - the named job did not run for this commit at all -- either no
#       check-run with that name exists (e.g. a Gitea repo, which has no
#       GitHub Actions job of that name -- or a workflow run that has not
#       dispatched that job yet), or it exists with conclusion "skipped"
#       (the job's own `if:` condition evaluated false for this commit,
#       e.g. `worker-image-smoke`'s docker-changed-files gate). --quiet
#       prints "not_found" for the former and "skipped" for the latter so
#       callers can tell the two apart; both are exit 3 (not a false
#       pass/fail) per the aggregate mode's existing "3 = unknown" bucket.
#
# Environment Variables:
#   LOOM_CI_TIMEOUT - Timeout for API calls in seconds (default: 10)
#   LOOM_FORGE_TYPE - Override forge detection ("github" or "gitea")
#
# Examples:
#   ./check-ci-status.sh                    # Check HEAD status
#   ./check-ci-status.sh --commit abc123    # Check specific commit
#   ./check-ci-status.sh --json             # JSON output for scripting
#   ./check-ci-status.sh --quiet && echo "CI passed!"
#   ./check-ci-status.sh --job "loom-worker Image Smoke Test" --quiet
#
# The Auditor uses this script to determine whether to skip redundant build/test
# when CI has already validated the main branch, and (--job) to look up a
# single docker-dependent job's real conclusion when it cannot run that leg
# itself locally (no docker on the Auditor host, #5748).
