# Focus (#3911): a bare `loom-daemon-start.sh` must default FLAGS-OFF — it must
# NOT enable the autonomous work finder. Opt-in (--work-finder / --health-gate /
# --from-config) and explicit-off (--no-work-finder) must still behave.
#
# Style matches test-spawn-claude.sh — plain bash, hand-rolled assertions.

#
# Strategy: drive the script in --foreground mode against a FAKE daemon binary
# that prints the LOOM_WORK_FINDER / LOOM_MAIN_HEALTH_GATE it inherited, then
# assert on that marker line. --foreground `exec`s the binary, so the exported
# env is exactly what a real daemon would see.

# WHICH BINARY IMPLEMENTS THE STUB (#8134, epic #7810 / #8087)
#
# loom-daemon-start.sh is a thin stub over `loom-daemon daemon-start`, so this
# suite is only testing what it thinks it is if the stub execs the binary built
# from the working tree. `--self-only` is mandatory here and is exactly the
# case that flag exists for: this suite pins $LOOM_DAEMON_BIN to FAKE daemon
# binaries (one that prints the autonomy env it inherited, one that just
# sleeps) to exercise the LAUNCH path, and $LOOM_DAEMON_BIN means "the daemon
# this caller manages or probes" — not "the binary that implements me". Without
# --self-only the harness would export $LOOM_DAEMON_BIN over the top of those
# per-invocation pins AND hand the stub a fake to exec as itself.
#
# This is a HARNESS change, not an assertion change: every expectation below is
# byte-for-byte what it was against the shell. Editing the oracle to fit the
# answer is never the cheap option (verification-recipes.md §6).

# wait_for_pid_file_gone (#7287) — deterministic teardown for the
# kill-then-immediately-`rm -f` pattern used throughout this suite's systemd
# fixtures. The old shape (`kill "$PID" || true` followed immediately by
# `rm -f "$pid_file"`) never waited for anything: it fired the kill and moved
# straight on to the next invocation, which runs its OWN already-running guard
# (loom-daemon-start.sh reads `$pid_file`, `kill -0`s the recorded pid, and
# exits early with a warm-only banner if that succeeds — #5409) before this
# one's target pid was confirmed gone. Under load that guard can spuriously
# fire on a pid that either hasn't exited yet or — since the systemd-unit test
# path here records a SYNTHETIC pid (the stub `systemctl show` subshell's own
# already-exited `$$`, not a real forked daemon) — has simply been recycled by
# the OS to some unrelated, currently-live process. Either way the next
# invocation's guard can be fooled into skipping the code path under test,
# which is exactly the intermittent DEK6b failure this issue reports.
#
# This helper closes the race: it kills the recorded pid (best-effort, same as
# before), then POLLS `kill -0` until it fails (truly gone) or a bounded
# timeout elapses, and only then removes the pid file — so the very next
# invocation can never observe a live-looking pid left over from this one.
# On timeout it fails LOUDLY (hard exit, not a silent `|| true`) rather than
# hang forever: a pid that is still alive after several seconds is either a
# genuinely stuck fixture daemon (a real bug worth stopping the suite for) or,
# in the rare pid-recycling case, an unrelated process that has occupied the
# slot for that whole window — a coincidence a short-lived collision would not
# survive, so the timeout is deliberately several times longer than any single

# suite-wide FLOOR, not a replacement for every case: tests below that need a
# specific fixture's OWN scratch HOME still pin LOOM_SOCKET_PATH /
# LOOM_AUTONOMY_MARKER inline on their own invocation (a per-command assignment
# always wins over this exported default, same precedence as before). This
# only closes the call sites that do NOT pin them — e.g. tests 1-7 below run
# with no override at all, so pre-fix they resolved LOOM_SOCKET_PATH's default
# fallback (`${LOOM_SOCKET_PATH:-$HOME/.loom/loom-daemon.sock}` in
# loom-daemon-start.sh) straight onto the REAL $HOME/.loom.
#
# The return code is CHECKED, never bare (#6420). init returns non-zero when it
# could not `cd` into the sandbox root (#6386 — the cwd tier is then still aimed
# at wherever this suite was launched from, i.e. potentially a LIVE checkout) or
# when the ambient supervisor label is the real production one (#5501). This
# suite runs under `set -uo pipefail` with NO `-e`, so a bare call would swallow
# both and continue with a HALF-ARMED sandbox — the exact state the helper's own
# failure path exists to prevent — while driving the real lifecycle scripts.

# ---------- dropped-env-key detection on re-render (#4522, preserve-by-default #5344) ----------
# Root cause under test: render_launchd_plist / render_systemd_unit render the
# EnvironmentVariables dict / Environment= lines strictly from whatever THIS
# invocation has exported -- so a re-render from a context missing the
# operator's exports (a watchdog, a bare re-run, another tool shelling out to
# this script) used to silently replace a richer installed plist/unit with a
# narrower one (every LOOM_SAFEHOUSE_* key + LOOM_WORK_FINDER gone, no trace).
# warn_dropped_env_keys() diffs the KEY sets (not values) between the
# installed file and the freshly-rendered replacement, warns, AND (#5344, by
# default) carries each dropped key's installed VALUE forward into the
# replacement before it is installed -- a re-render can now only widen or
# match the installed file, never narrow it, unless --force-env is passed.

# ---------- launchd (plist) path -- exercised read-only via --print-plist,
# same technique as the #4172 PATH-drift tests above (the real launchd
# install branch is Darwin-gated with no test-force seam, matching every

# Exercised through the REAL nohup install path (--no-launchd --no-systemd,

# ---------- KillMode=mixed real-systemd regression (#4862) ----------
# The stub-based systemd tests above assert the RENDERED TEXT of the unit
# (Restart=on-success, KillMode=mixed present) but never exercise a real
# `systemd --user` manager, so they cannot catch a regression in what those
# fields actually DO. This block drives the ACTUAL production-rendered unit
# (via --print-unit, only ExecStart/WorkingDirectory substituted) against a
# real `systemctl --user` when one is reachable, proving BOTH halves of the
# issue's acceptance criteria in one shot:
#   MX1. a clean exit(0) with a SIGTERM-ignoring lingering child (standing in
#        for an in-flight claude/tee/sleep sweep worker) still causes
#        Restart=on-success to fire — the #4862 fix.
#   MX2. a crash exit(1) does NOT get restarted — the #4054 no-crash-loop
#        property must survive the #4862 change (KillMode=mixed touches only
#        HOW leftover cgroup members are reaped, never the crash/on-success
#        exit-code contract).
# Skips cleanly (not a failure) when no reachable `systemd --user` manager
# exists — e.g. a Darwin CI runner, or a sandboxed host with no user
# session/bus. Real unit files land under the ACTUAL $HOME (systemd --user
# cannot be redirected via an env HOME override the way the stub-based tests
# above redirect it), uniquely named with $$ so a leftover from an
# interrupted run cannot collide with a later one.
#
# OPT-IN ONLY (LOOM_TEST_ALLOW_SYSTEMD=1, #8077). "Reachable `systemctl --user`"
# used to be the whole gate, which meant this block ran unconditionally on every
# FLEET WORKER — where the reachable user manager is the one supervising the
# PRODUCTION loom-daemon. That is not a hypothetical: a builder sweep on
# loom-worker-2 (2026-09-17) drove 32 × `systemctl --user daemon-reload` into
# the live manager from here. Unlike every other resolution tier in this file,
# this one has no env seam to redirect — the ONLY safe default is not to run it.
# CI keeps its coverage by setting LOOM_TEST_ALLOW_SYSTEMD=1 explicitly on a
# runner with no production daemon; a sweep never does (spawn-worker.sh exports
# `0`), so the two cases stay distinguishable without a host heuristic.

# ---------- --heal-watchdog-only: periodic host-resident re-provisioning (#5405) ----------
# #5343's heal_watchdog_provisioning_gap() only ever fires as a SIDE EFFECT of
# re-running this script (an operator by hand, `fleet add-worker`, or the
# already-running-guard exercised by H1-H4 above) -- a host that was
# provisioned pre-#5343 and simply keeps running forever never gets healed.
# --heal-watchdog-only is the narrow standalone entry point a host-resident
# periodic caller (the daemon's own watchdog_provisioning_guard loop) can
# invoke safely and repeatedly. Unlike H1-H4, these fixtures deliberately do
# NOT fabricate an "already running" PID file -- the whole point of this flag
# is to work independent of that state -- and assert the daemon-start path
# (binary invocation, PID file creation) is never reached.

# H5. Marker present + watchdog NOT yet provisioned + NO pid file at all (the
#     already-running guard's branch is never even reached) -> still
#     provisions the watchdog, and never invokes the daemon binary or writes
#     a PID file.

# would WIDEN (not narrow) what a start touches: the ambient LOOM_PID_FILE in
# any agent session names the LIVE daemon's pid file, and this script rm -f's,
# rewrites, and hands that path to a new daemon (#5179's shape). These cases
# pin that decision so it cannot be "aligned" away silently; the rationale
# lives at the derivation site in loom-daemon-start.sh.

# Incident 2026-08-17: a daemon-dispatched sweep (issue #6388, checkout under
# /tmp) invoked this script to exercise the start path. With no
# LOOM_LAUNCHD_LABEL set it targeted the fixed production label, so it
# OVERWROTE ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.rjwalters.loom-daemon.plist on BOTH
# operator Macs with a plist rendered from its own session env
# (LOOM_SWEEP_CLAIM_OWNED=6388, LOOM_TERMINAL_ID=..., LOOM_ROLE=sweep-lifecycle,
# LOOM_RUNTIME=claude, a /tmp WorkingDirectory, mktemp'd watchdog/socket/pid
# paths, and a stray LOOM_ROLE_RUNNER_INTERVAL_SECS=900). Undetected for two
# days.
#
# test-loom-daemon-launchd-plist.sh covers the RENDER side (the env strip and
# the warn-only preview). These cases cover what a preview structurally
# cannot: the REAL install path -- that the refusal happens BEFORE any
# supervisor call or file write, that the documented exemptions still let a
# real start through, and that a start with no session context is untouched.
#
# Safety: every case runs with a scratch $HOME and a stub systemctl/launchctl
# on PATH, so even a completely broken guard cannot reach real supervisor
# state -- the assertion is on the RECORDED STUB CALLS, never on this
# machine's launchd/systemd. The systemd branch is forced (LOOM_SYSTEMD_FORCE=1
# + --no-launchd) so these run identically on a Darwin and a Linux runner, the
