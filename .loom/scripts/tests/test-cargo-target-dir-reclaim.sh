# test-cargo-target-dir-reclaim.sh — `worktree.sh remove` reclaims a REDIRECTED
# cargo target directory (issue #7239).
#
# Covers the removal-time half of lib/cargo-target-dir.sh:
#   1. A per-worktree target dir redirected OUTSIDE the worktree is reclaimed
#      when its worktree is removed.
#   2. A target dir another LIVE worktree also resolves to is left untouched
#      (the host-optimize single-shared-target-dir convention) — and IS
#      reclaimed once that last referencing worktree is gone too.
#   3. `--dry-run` lists the reclaimable dir with its size and deletes nothing.
#   4. The default in-worktree `target/` is never reported as a reclaim (it
#      disappears with the worktree for free).
#   5. A dir a live process is sitting in is left untouched.
#   6. Paths the pass must never delete (the repo itself, the primary
#      checkout's own `target/`) are refused.
#   7. Resolution parity with the standalone scripts/cargo-target-dir.sh, so
#      the library twin can never drift from the script it mirrors.
#   9. An ambient CARGO_TARGET_DIR is never treated as this worktree's own
#      directory — the data-loss regression this suite exists to pin.
#
# Follows the throwaway-repo harness pattern in test-worktree-remove.sh: a bare
# origin remote + a working repo, with worktree.sh + its lib/ helpers copied
# into a temp tree, then the script driven directly. Hermetic: no forge, no
# network, no Rust toolchain (a stub `cargo metadata`, below, stands in for the
# real one).
#
# ## Why the redirects here come from .cargo/config.toml, not CARGO_TARGET_DIR
#
# CARGO_TARGET_DIR is read from the REMOVER'S OWN environment: it is machine-
# or session-global and resolves identically for every path on the host, so it
# can never be evidence that a directory belongs to one worktree. Driving these
# fixtures with it would have been testing the one shape the library must
# refuse (and did, before this suite was rewritten alongside that fix — Test 9
# is the regression guard). Every redirect below therefore uses the mechanism
# the feature actually reclaims: `build.target-dir` in a per-worktree
# `.cargo/config.toml`, the host-optimize convention issue #7239 describes.

# --- A hermetic stand-in for `cargo metadata` -------------------------------
# The resolver reads a `build.target-dir` redirect by asking cargo, so a
# config.toml-driven fixture needs *some* cargo on PATH. Depending on a real
# Rust toolchain would make this suite non-hermetic (it runs in the shell-only
# CI job) and slow, so stand in a cargo that implements exactly the slice of
# the contract the resolver uses: report `target_directory` from the nearest
# `.cargo/config.toml` on the lookup path (env first, as real cargo does),
# else `<cwd>/target`.
mkdir -p "$TMP/bin" "$TMP/cargo-home"
#
# Two behaviors of real cargo matter to the gates below and are reproduced
# faithfully: `$CARGO_HOME/config.toml` is the last stop on the lookup path
# (Test 10's shapes D and E hinge on it), and `cargo metadata` can simply FAIL
# — a mid-edit Cargo.toml, a conflicted merge — which a `.cargo-metadata-broken`
# marker in the workspace simulates hermetically (Test 10b/10c).

# --- Test 9: an ambient CARGO_TARGET_DIR is never this worktree's own dir ----
# The data-loss regression. CARGO_TARGET_DIR is read from the REMOVER'S OWN
# environment — a single shared build cache for the whole machine is a common
# dev-host setting — so its mere presence can never establish that a directory
# belongs to the one worktree being removed. Both halves are pinned here,
# because closing only the first one still deletes:
#
#   9a. A worktree with NO manifest (every non-Rust consumer repo) must not
#       resolve to the ambient path at all: the manifest pre-check runs BEFORE
#       the env short-circuit, so it resolves to its own <worktree>/target.
#   9b. A worktree WITH a manifest, inside a repo whose root and siblings have
#       none, passes that pre-check and does resolve to the ambient path — and
#       the sharing scan skips every manifest-less tree, so nothing looks
#       shared. The reclaim step itself must refuse.

# --- Test 10: the other two machine-global attribution sources ---------------
# Same defect class as Test 9, two more members of it. A directory may only be
# deleted on evidence that it belongs to THE ONE worktree being removed, and
# neither of these is such evidence:
#
#   D. `build.target-dir` in $CARGO_HOME/config.toml (or any ancestor
#      .cargo/config.toml above the worktree). Exactly as machine-global as
#      CARGO_TARGET_DIR — every worktree on the host resolves to the same dir.
#   E. A DEGRADED resolution of some other live worktree. When `cargo metadata`
#      fails for a sibling, the resolver falls back to `<sibling>/target`, so a
#      sibling that really does build into the dir we are about to delete stops
#      counting as a sharer. "Builds elsewhere" and "could not find out" must
#      not look alike — the same rule already applied to `git worktree list`.
