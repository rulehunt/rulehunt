#!/usr/bin/env bash
# test-branch-landed.sh — unit tests for the shared `branch_landed` primitive
# (#7812, defaults/scripts/lib/branch-landed.sh).
#
# Every case runs against a disposable local fixture repo under `mktemp -d`;
# nothing here touches the network. The forge rung is exercised by redefining
# `_branch_landed_forge_probe` after sourcing (the seam the library documents),
# and suppressed entirely with LOOM_BRANCH_LANDED_OFFLINE=1 for the cases that
# are about the offline tree-equality path.
#
# Coverage (the acceptance criteria of #7812):
#   1. squash-merged branch                -> landed   (tree equality)
#   2. rebase-merged branch (SHAs rewritten) -> landed (tree equality)
#   3. merge-commit-merged branch          -> landed   (ancestry)
#   4. un-merged branch with real commits  -> not-landed
#   5. no PR at all, offline               -> answered by git alone
#   6. forge reports a merged PR           -> landed, PR number surfaced
#   7. merged PR + extra local commits     -> not-landed (conservative)
#   8. caller-supplied merged head SHA     -> landed with NO forge call
#   9. git < 2.38 simulated                -> ancestry still works; otherwise
#                                             the fail-closed `unknown`
#  10. conflicting branch                  -> not-landed
#  11. unresolvable branch / no default    -> unknown (never a guess)
#  12. unresolvable branch + forge match   -> not-landed, not landed (#7872)
