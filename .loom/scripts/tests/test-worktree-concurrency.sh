# test-worktree-concurrency.sh — Tests for worktree.sh concurrency lock + partial-state cleanup (#3380)
#
# Verifies the fix for "worktree.sh chronic hangs on concurrent invocations":
#   - Parallel invocations against different issues serialize cleanly and finish quickly.
#   - Parallel invocations against the same issue produce no partial state.
#   - Stale `.git/worktrees/issue-N/index.lock` files are recovered automatically.
#   - Half-created `.loom/worktrees/issue-N/` dirs (not registered with git) are removed
#     and recreated, instead of erroring out with the "Directory exists but is not a
#     registered worktree" path.
#   - A stale lock dir from a dead PID is recovered (not stranded).
#   - On lock-acquisition timeout, --json emits the documented error schema.
#
# Also covers the issue #6014 fixes:
#   - A late release from a stale/wedged holder (wrong acquisition token)
#     cannot remove a different, currently-live holder's lock.
#   - A release with no token (never acquired / already released) is a no-op.
#   - The git-worktree-add lock is released as soon as `git worktree add`
#     completes, not held through a slow post-worktree hook -- a second,
#     unrelated invocation is not serialized behind the first one's hook.
#
# Pattern follows test-worktree-sentinel.sh: throw-away bare origin + clone in a
# mktemp dir, copy worktree.sh + lib/, exercise behaviors.
