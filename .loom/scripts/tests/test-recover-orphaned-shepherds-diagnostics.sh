# test-recover-orphaned-shepherds-diagnostics.sh — Regression guard for #6392.
#
# Bug: recover-orphaned-shepherds.sh execs straight into a resolved
# `loom-daemon recover-orphans` and inherits its stderr. Before this fix,
# lib/locate-daemon-bin.sh's `loom_locate_daemon_bin: resolved ... via ...`
# success trace (#4997) was always printed to stderr ahead of the exec, so a
# caller that surfaces "the first line of stderr" as the failure reason on
# any non-zero exit (e.g. /loom:sweep's orphan-recovery capability
# pre-probe) could end up quoting that success trace verbatim — which reads
# like the failure itself even though it always reports a successful
# resolution. Observed live: `loom-daemon recover-orphans` exiting 2
# ("orphans found in dry-run mode" — itself not a failure, see
# cleanup_ops.rs) previously emitted no stderr diagnostic of its own at all,
# leaving the trace as the ONLY line in stderr.
#
# This suite asserts, with a fake `loom-daemon` standing in for the real
# binary (so it needs no build and is fast/hermetic):
#   1. By default (no --verbose/-v), the resolution-success trace is
#      suppressed and does not appear anywhere in stderr.
#   2. The exec'd binary's own stderr output still passes through untouched
#      — the wrapper does not eat or reorder it.
#   3. With --verbose (or -v), the resolution-success trace DOES appear in
#      stderr again (opt-in, not removed outright — other callers of the
#      shared lib function still get it unconditionally, see
#      test-locate-daemon-bin.sh).
#   4. The script's own header documents what each exit code means (#6392
#      AC3).
#
# Usage:
#   ./.loom/scripts/tests/test-recover-orphaned-shepherds-diagnostics.sh
