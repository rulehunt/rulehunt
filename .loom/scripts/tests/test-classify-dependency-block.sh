# test-classify-dependency-block.sh - Tests for classify-dependency-block.sh
# (issue #5664), the timing-vs-merits split in Champion's escalation decision.
#
# Champion escalated a proposal to `loom:operator-only` after N=2 unrevised
# evaluations regardless of WHY it kept failing. For a proposal whose only
# finding was "hard dependency on #3, which is still open" that turned a
# self-clearing timing condition into a permanent one: `loom:operator-only`
# makes Champion skip the issue forever, so the only actor that could notice #3
# had closed was the one told to ignore it. In the motivating incident #3 merged
# minutes after three dependents were escalated on it.
#
# This suite is hybrid, mirroring test-detect-dependency-cycle.sh:
#
#   1. extract_findings / is_dependency_finding / findings_are_dependency_only /
#      _extract_refs / _fingerprint are real sourceable functions (the script
#      guards its main on `BASH_SOURCE == $0`), tested directly.
#   2. Both modes, their exit codes, and the --apply side effects are exercised
#      black-box by stubbing `gh` on PATH and running the real script.
#   3. The Champion prose call sites are pinned with literal assert_doc_contains
#      checks, so wiring the gate out of the role files fails here.
#
# Hermetic: no network, no live forge, no tokens. Every read goes to the stub.

**Champion: Escalating to Operator — Repeated Rejection Without Revision**

This proposal has been evaluated 2+ times with converging feedback (1 posted
rejection(s) plus 1 silent skip(s) of an unchanged proposal), but has not been
revised to address it.

**Recurring findings:**
- Technical Feasibility (no obvious blockers): Hard dependency on #3, which is
  still open.

A human needs to decide whether to revise this proposal, close it, or accept it
as-is.

**Champion Review: NEEDS REVISION**

This issue requires additional work before promotion to `loom:issue`:

- Scope Appropriateness: this is three issues in one and cannot be built atomically.

**Recommended actions:**
- Split into per-phase issues (see #3 for the pattern).

# =====================================================================
# Where the pure-helper unit tests went (epic #7810, PR 3)
# =====================================================================
#
# This suite used to `source "$CDB"` and call extract_findings /
# is_dependency_finding / findings_are_dependency_only / _extract_refs /
# _fingerprint directly — the script guarded its `main` on `BASH_SOURCE == $0`
# precisely so it could. Those functions no longer exist in shell: they are
# `loom-daemon/src/dep_classify/{findings,finding,refs,fingerprint}.rs`, with
# their own unit tests.
#
# They were not translated on trust. #7943 landed each port alongside a
# DIFFERENTIAL test that ran the Rust function and the shell function over the
# same fixture corpus and asserted they agreed, character for character. Those
# differential tests are deleted in this change, with the shell they compared
# against — a comparison needs both sides, and keeping a copy of the shell
# purely to compare with would be keeping the thing this epic retires. The
# evidence is the merged CI run, not a permanent fixture.
#
# What remains below is the part that CAN still be proven both ways: every
# black-box assertion, written against the shell implementation, run unchanged
# against the Rust one through the same CLI.

# =====================================================================
# Black-box: stub `gh` on PATH, run the real script

it as-is.

# =====================================================================
#
# This suite used to run lib/heredoc-body-safety.sh over _apply_unescalation,
# _apply_fact_unescalation and _report_cycle. The trap it guarded is a bash 3.2
# parsing bug — a heredoc body inside `"$(cat <<EOF ...)"` is scanned for a
# closing paren, so punctuation in the prose silently produces an EMPTY body.
# All three functions are Rust now, and none of these three scripts contains a
# heredoc any more, so there is nothing here for that scan to find.
#
# The scan itself is NOT retired: it stays wired into the watchdog suites for
# the rest of the repo's shell. See defaults/scripts/tests/lib/heredoc-body-safety.sh.
