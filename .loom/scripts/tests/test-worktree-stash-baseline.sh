# test-worktree-stash-baseline.sh - Tests for the `worktree.sh stash-push
# <N>` / `worktree.sh stash-pop <N>` verb pair (#5217)
#
# Verifies the worktree-scoped, per-issue clean-baseline stash:
#   1. stash-push captures tracked-file changes and resets the worktree to a
#      clean baseline WITHOUT touching `git stash` (stash list identical
#      before/after — unlike raw `git stash push`, which IS gated by
#      guard-destructive-generic.sh's stash-scope:worktree-collision ask).
#   2. stash-pop restores exactly what stash-push captured (tracked diff).
#   3. --include-untracked moves untracked files out on push and restores
#      them on pop; the default omits them.
#   4. A clean worktree still succeeds (no-op push, nothing to reset).
#   5. A second stash-push before pop refuses (no data loss / no silent
#      overwrite of a pending baseline).
#   6. stash-pop with nothing pending fails cleanly, without side effects.
#   7. stash-push / stash-pop on a non-existent worktree fail cleanly.
#   8. --json emits a single parseable document for both verbs.
#   9. Loom runtime markers are never swept into the untracked holding dir.
#  10. The per-issue ref (refs/loom/stash-baseline/issue-<N>) is created by
#      push and cleared by pop — never left dangling on a clean round trip.
#  11. Another worktree's `git stash push` landing BETWEEN a stash-push and
#      its stash-pop cannot corrupt the restore (the #5217 race), and does
#      not consume that worktree's shared-stack entry either.
#  12. Contrast fixture: the raw `git stash push`/`pop` pattern DOES lose to
#      the identical interleaving — which is why the guard's ask on raw
#      stash pop/drop/clear must stay exactly as strict as before.
#  13. The full `stash-push && <check> && stash-pop` chain exits 0 even when
#      the worktree was already clean (a pop with nothing captured is a
#      no-op, not an error, so the chain cannot break mid-sweep).
#
# Follows the throwaway-repo harness pattern in test-worktree-snapshot.sh: a
# bare origin remote + a working repo, with worktree.sh + its lib/ helpers
# copied into a temp tree, then the script driven directly.
#
# Needs a BUILT `loom-daemon` since #8195 slice 2: `worktree.sh stash-push` /
# `stash-pop` are now thin stubs over `loom-daemon worktree-wip`. Every
# assertion below is unchanged from the shell implementation — running them
# against the port is the equivalence evidence — so this suite moved to the
# "Native Port Suites" CI job, which builds the binary, and FAILS rather than
# skips without one.
#
# Usage:
#   cargo build --package loom-daemon
#   bash defaults/scripts/tests/test-worktree-stash-baseline.sh
