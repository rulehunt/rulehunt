# test-sweep-lease-fence-race.sh - Regression suite: does the Phase 3
# sweep-side lease fencing check (sweep-lease-fence.sh, #6309) actually
# bound a two-host ACQUISITION race to one wasted build (Issue #6310, Epic
# #6165 Phase 3).
#
# ## Why this is a separate suite from test-sweep-lease-fence.sh
#
# test-sweep-lease-fence.sh already unit-tests each fencing outcome
# (fresh/owned -> PASS, expired -> ABORT EXPIRED, superseded -> ABORT
# SUPERSEDED, every fail-open case) against hand-picked single-comment
# fixtures, run through ONE invocation of the script. That is necessary but
# not sufficient evidence for the epic's own acceptance criterion ("no
# sweep opens a PR while its lease is expired or held elsewhere") -- it
# proves the CHECK's exit code is correct, not that the exit code actually
# gates the externally-visible side effect (a pushed branch / opened PR)
# for BOTH sides of a genuine two-writer race at once.
#
# This suite is explicitly NOT re-testing Phase 2 (the daemon's
# reclamation-side lease-freshness guard, `claim_reconciliation.rs`'s
# `lease_is_fresh` / `fetch_freshest_lease_updated_at`) -- that is already
# covered end-to-end by
# `loom-daemon/src/sweep_registry/dispatch.rs`'s
# `combined_dispatch_and_reclaim_race_produces_no_duplicate_build_with_safehouse_down`
# test (Issue #6288). Where #6288 composes Phase 2's dispatch-time
# claim-then-verify-order tie-break (#6287) with Phase 2's reclamation
# lease-freshness guard (#6286), this suite composes Phase 3's fencing
# check with a MOCK push/PR-open step, against a race scenario #6287's
# dispatch-time tie-break does not fully cover: two hosts that both got as
# far as *starting a build* (so #6287 already let both dispatches through,
# or one host's claim was later reclaimed and re-dispatched to a second
# host while the first host's build was still in flight) and are now both
# racing to reach the one irreversible step -- push / PR-open.
#
# ## Harness shape
#
# Mirrors test-sweep-lease-fence.sh's `gh` stub (real `jq` applies the
# script's own `--jq` filter against a canned comments fixture) but adds a
# `simulate_sweep_attempt` helper that runs the REAL sweep-lease-fence.sh
# `check` subprocess for a given host and, ONLY if it exits 0, appends that
# host's identity to a shared `pushed.log` -- modeling "this sweep proceeded
# to push its branch and open its PR". A host whose check aborts (exit 3 or
# 4) must produce ZERO lines in pushed.log; this is the negative-space
# assertion the issue's acceptance criteria call for ("not zero, not two").
#
# Covers:
#   (1) Acquisition race resolved by host identity: two hosts each hold a
#       fresh lease comment for the same issue, one strictly freshest by
#       forge `updated_at` ordering -> the freshest host's push proceeds,
#       the other aborts SUPERSEDED before any push/PR-open.
#   (2) Acquisition race resolved by elapsed time: the losing host's own
#       lease record goes stale (no renewal reached it before its build
#       got to the push step) -> it aborts EXPIRED before any push/PR-open,
#       and only afterward does a second host's later dispatch (re-claiming
#       the abandoned issue, modeled purely as the forge state left behind
#       by such a re-claim -- Phase 2's own reclaim mechanism is NOT
#       exercised here, see #6288 above) write a fresh lease and succeed.
#   (3) Winner-unaffected: in both (1) and (2), the winning host's own
#       fencing check is a genuine PASS (fresh lease, host match) rather
#       than an accidental fail-open "no evidence" PASS -- and it is not
#       disturbed by having run alongside (or after) the losing host's
#       aborted attempt against the SAME shared comment store.
#   (4) Combined negative-space assertion: across the full two-attempt
#       sequence of each race, pushed.log contains EXACTLY one entry --
#       never zero (the winner must still succeed) and never two (the
#       fencing check must actually block the loser).
#   (5) Issue #6485's own race shape: two lease comments within the same
#       second, the LATER one's host posts its own `loom:lease-yield`
#       standdown record and then keeps its lease looking fresh (as if a
#       misdirected renewal loop kept PATCHing it after the standdown) --
#       the EARLIER (tie-break-winning) host's fencing check must still
#       PASS even though its own lease was never renewed at all.
#   (6) Edge case guarding (5): the SAME fixture shape with the yield
#       record removed -- a genuinely fresher peer lease that never
#       yielded must still correctly SUPERSEDE the earlier host. This is
#       the negative check that (5)'s fix has not weakened ordinary
#       fencing for a lease that simply never yielded.
#   (7) Issue #6783's own incident shape (issue #6694 / PR #6773): the
#       ONLY lease record on the issue was written by a host that has since
#       died -- never renewed again, never yielded -- and is now well past
#       the TTL, with zero live competitors. A successor sweep on a
#       DIFFERENT host, dispatched later with no lease of its own yet, must
#       PASS its fencing check (not be permanently fenced out by the
#       abandoned record) and go on to push/PR-open.
