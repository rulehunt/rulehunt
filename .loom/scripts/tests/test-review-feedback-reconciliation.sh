# test-review-feedback-reconciliation.sh - Regression coverage for the formal
# review / inline thread reconciliation gate (#7647).
#
# THE FAILURE SHAPE THIS PINS DOWN
#
#   In kicad-tools#5369 a Judge approved a PR at head 23a0289 while an
#   unresolved formal CHANGES_REQUESTED review sat at that same head. The
#   approving pass had read the PR's ISSUE comments (`/issues/{n}/comments`)
#   and never the formal reviews (`/pulls/{n}/reviews`), so a positive issue
#   comment was the only feedback it saw. Green CI did not exercise the missing
#   requirement either.
#
#   The suite therefore asserts, against a fully mocked forge:
#     T1  a blocking review that only appears on PAGE 2 is still found
#     T2  same-head CHANGES_REQUESTED + a positive issue comment cannot produce
#         an unqualified approval (the #5369 shape)
#     T3  an unresolved inline review THREAD blocks
#     T4  an older-head finding needs reconciliation, and MAY proceed once the
#         caller supplies evidence citing it
#     T5  a read failure / incomplete pagination fails CLOSED (never "clean")
#     T6  a clean, fully-reconciled review state approves normally
#
# Black-box: both subjects are full CLI scripts, so `gh` is stubbed on PATH and
# the real scripts run as subprocesses (same pattern as test-post-verdict.sh).
# The stub emulates `gh api --paginate --jq` faithfully — it applies the
# caller's real jq filter to each fixture page in turn — so the pagination
# assertions exercise the production jq filters, not a paraphrase of them.
#
# Usage:
#   ./.loom/scripts/tests/test-review-feedback-reconciliation.sh
