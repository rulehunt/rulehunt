# test-guide-work-plan-operator-only-exclude.sh - Regression test for issue #7008
#
# guide.md's `render_plan_body()` (WORK_PLAN.md's machine-generated region)
# has SIX forge queries: `urgent`/`ready`/`building`/`review`/`approved`/
# `curated`. The `ready` query (feeding the "Ready" section, documented as
# "Human-approved issues ready for implementation") filtered only on
# `--label "loom:issue"` — unlike the "Finding Work" search earlier in the
# same file, which already excludes `loom:building` and `loom:operator-only`
# via `--search "-label:loom:building -label:loom:operator-only"` (#6941).
#
# `loom:operator-only` (per `.github/labels.yml`: "sweep skips") means a
# Builder can never act on the issue — exactly like `loom:blocked` — so it
# must never render as "ready for implementation". Issue #6245
# (`loom:issue,loom:operator-only,loom:operator-blocked`, stable since
# 2026-08-25) rendered into the Ready section across three consecutive Guide
# document-maintenance ticks (PRs #7005/#7006/#7007), producing a trickle of
# near-content-free "docs: Guide document maintenance update" PRs.
#
# The `building` query had the same structural gap: `loom:operator-only` is
# not documented as mutually exclusive with `loom:building` in
# `.github/labels.yml`, so an issue could render into "In Progress" while
# actually stuck on a human-only decision.
#
# THE FIX: both queries gain the same `--search` exclusion clause the
# "Finding Work" query already uses:
#   ready:    --search "-label:loom:building -label:loom:operator-only"
#   building: --search "-label:loom:operator-only"
#
# #7071 EXTENSION: the `ready` query (and the "Finding Work" search, and the
# incumbency-rule eligibility checks — covered by their own regression
# suites) never excluded `loom:blocked`, only `loom:operator-only` — despite
# `loom:blocked` meaning exactly the same thing for a Builder ("can never act
# on this right now"). An issue can carry `loom:issue` + `loom:blocked`
# simultaneously (Curator applies `loom:blocked` pre-approval, and a
# dependency-driven block can land on an already-approved issue too), so this
# suite is extended to also cover that combination:
#   ready:    --search "-label:loom:building -label:loom:operator-only -label:loom:blocked"
#
# Verifies that:
#   1. STRUCTURE: guide.md's `ready=` and `building=` queries inside
#      `render_plan_body()` carry the expected `--search` exclusion clauses.
#   2. THE REGRESSION, executed rather than grepped: the REAL
#      `render_plan_body()` (extracted from guide.md and eval'd against a
#      stubbed `$GH_READ` that honours `--search "-label:X"` the way real
#      `gh` combines `--label` (AND) with `--search` negation) excludes an
#      issue carrying `loom:issue` + `loom:operator-only` from the Ready
#      section, and an issue carrying `loom:building` + `loom:operator-only`
#      from the In Progress section.
#   3. NO OVER-EXCLUSION: a plain `loom:issue` issue (no operator-only/
#      building) still appears in Ready; a plain `loom:building` issue still
#      appears in In Progress.
#   4. NEGATIVE CONTROL: the pre-fix (unfiltered) `ready`/`building`
#      pipelines DO include the operator-only issues — i.e. this test would
#      have failed before the fix (reproduces #6245's flap).
#
# Hermetic: `gh` is stubbed with fixture JSON; only the real `jq` binary is
# invoked (skipped if unavailable) — no forge/network calls.
