#!/usr/bin/env bash
# test-classify-ac-verification.sh - tests for classify-ac-verification.sh,
# Champion's out-of-band acceptance-criteria gate (#6883).
#
# Covers the five exit states (0 CLEAR / 10 NO-AC / 11 SATISFIED / 12 UNVERIFIED
# / 13 STALE-MARKER), the extraction scope (AC headings only -- Test Plan and
# Dependencies checklists are deliberately NOT swept), wrapped-bullet joining,
# "a checked box is not evidence", the `loom:ac-verified` marker's anchoring and
# abbreviation-tolerant SHA comparison, the #4840-style prose-quoting false-
# positive guard, and the bare-word false-positive discipline the vocabulary is
# built around.
#
# Hermetic: drives the script purely through --body-file / --evidence-file, so
# no forge, network, or token is touched.
#
# Usage:
#   ./defaults/scripts/tests/test-classify-ac-verification.sh
