# test-merge-pr-app-permission-fallback.sh - Unit tests for the App-token
# permission-scope 403 escalation on the MERGE path (#6752).
#
# #6074 gave every shell `gh` write site a 3-rung credential ladder
# (ambient -> force-minted installation token -> personal token) that recovers
# from `403 Resource not accessible by integration`. The merge itself bypassed
# it on BOTH of its write paths:
#
#   * `merge-pr.sh` calls the native Rust `loom-daemon forge auto-merge`, which
#     has its own forge-write code entirely outside the bash ladder, and
#   * the synchronous path's `forge_merge_pr` issued a bare `gh api ... -X PUT`.
#
# Observed live 2026-08-22 (`/loom:sweep 6746`, PR #6751): `merge-pr.sh --auto`
# died with the exact integration-403 while the same repo's comment/label
# writes recovered through the ladder; the orchestrator had to `unset
# GH_CONFIG_DIR` by hand — rung 3, performed manually — to complete the merge.
#
# This file tests:
#   1. forge_cmd_perm_safe(): the ladder generalized past `gh` — a clean call
#      runs once and never mints; an integration-403 escalates to a FORCE-minted
#      installation token and then to a personal token; a non-permission failure
#      escalates nothing; and the wrapped command's own exit code is preserved
#      verbatim (loom-daemon's 3 = forge declined, 4 = head-SHA mismatch must
#      never be retried or rewritten).
#   2. forge_merge_pr() (GitHub REST PUT) escalates on the integration-403 and
#      returns the merge payload from the escalated attempt.
#   3. merge-pr.sh routes the native `loom-daemon forge auto-merge` call through
#      forge_cmd_perm_safe (no bare invocation left behind).
#   4. No regression to #6074: forge_gh_perm_safe is still the `gh` spelling of
#      the same ladder and still escalates a `gh` write identically.
