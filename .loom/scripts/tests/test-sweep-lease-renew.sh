# test-sweep-lease-renew.sh - Unit tests for sweep-lease-renew.sh (#6180).
#
# Black-box tests: sweep-lease-renew.sh is a full CLI script (no functions to
# source), so `gh` is stubbed on PATH (real `jq` is used unstubbed — its
# logic is exactly what's under test) and the real script is invoked as a
# subprocess, asserting on stdout/stderr/exit code. Mirrors the stubbing
# pattern in test-judge-fallback-cap.sh.
#
# Covers:
#   (a) renew-once finds the newest lease-marker comment and PATCHes it,
#       preserving the first-line marker byte-for-byte
#   (b) renew-once is idempotent: a second call replaces (not accumulates)
#       the `loom:lease-renewed` trailer line
#   (c) renew-once ignores a comment whose body merely CONTAINS the marker
#       text without it being the first line (startswith, not substring)
#   (d) renew-once with no matching lease comment -> exit 2 (best-effort
#       no-op, not a hard failure)
#   (e) renew-once --host/--sweep-id requires an EXACT marker match, both
#       the miss and the hit cases
#   (f) renew-once --host without --sweep-id (and vice versa) -> usage error
#   (g) start spawns a background loop that self-terminates once its
#       watched PID dies (never renews after that point) — verifies the
#       "sweep exits -> renewal naturally stops" contract, entirely via a
#       real background process against the real script (no `gh` needed
#       for the termination half; the PATCH stub records call count too)
#   (h) stop kills a given PID
#   (i) renew-once's own-yield guard (#6485): a candidate lease whose own
#       (host, sweep) has a matching `loom:lease-yield` comment is NOT
#       PATCHed and exits 4 — both the miss (no matching yield) and hit
#       (matching yield) cases, plus a non-matching yield for a DIFFERENT
#       host/sweep that must NOT trip the guard
#   (j) start's default --host/--sweep-id auto-resolution (#6485): with
#       $LOOM_TERMINAL_ID=daemon-<sweep-id> and $LOOM_HOST_ID set, `start`
#       renews ONLY its own exact lease comment even when a PEER's lease
#       comment is the "newest" one on the issue — the exact misdirection
#       this issue reports (a live renewal loop keeping a peer's claim
#       looking fresh while its own claim's `updated_at` never advances)
#   (k) start's loop stops renewing (self-terminates) as soon as a
#       renew-once cycle reports the own-yield guard (exit 4), without
#       waiting for the watched PID to die
#   (l) renew-once's two `gh api` call sites (comments-list read, PATCH)
#       route through forge_gh_perm_safe's escalation ladder (#6541): a
#       GitHub App-installation permission-scope 403 on either call site
#       recovers via a freshly minted installation token and the renewal
#       still succeeds; when the ladder is fully exhausted, renew-once still
#       fails closed with the existing "ERROR: PATCH of lease comment ...
#       failed" message (never silently-allow-through)
#   (m) cmd_start's renewal loop emits a visible log line (Issue #6541) when
#       a renew-once cycle genuinely FAILS, even though the loop's own I/O is
#       unconditionally sent to /dev/null for detachment -- and does NOT log
#       a "failure" line for the normal exit-2 (no lease) or exit-4
#       (#6485 own-yield guard) outcomes, which are not failures
#   (n) start REFUSES (exit 1, no loop forked) a --host/--sweep-id pair that
#       could never match its own lease comment (#7876): whitespace in either
#       value -- the exact shape a zsh caller's `set -- $LEASE_IDENT`
#       produces, since zsh does not word-split unquoted parameters -- or a
#       half-empty pair; while passing NEITHER (the documented "newest wins"
#       fallback) and passing a correctly split pair both still work
#   (o) identity-pinned watch (Issue #7825, defect (a)): the loop exits when
#       the watched PID's START-TIME identity stops matching the token
#       recorded at `start` time, EVEN THOUGH the PID number is still live --
#       the PID-reuse defense -- and, as the control half, a loop whose
#       auto-probed identity genuinely does keep matching survives and keeps
#       renewing (the probe must not manufacture false "dead" verdicts)
#   (p) zombie reads as dead (Issue #7825, defect (b)): `pid_is_live` returns
#       non-zero for a real Z-state process, even though `kill -0` SUCCEEDS
#       for it -- which is exactly why the pre-#7825 `kill -0` fast path made
#       the documented `Z` branch unreachable
#   (q) absolute age backstop (Issue #7825): with
#       SWEEP_LEASE_RENEW_MAX_AGE_SECS=3 the loop exits within seconds even
#       when its watch target is deliberately IMMORTAL (pid 1), so the whole
#       failure class is bounded regardless of what the watch test believes
#   (r) the shared pid-liveness block is byte-identical in
#       sweep-lease-renew.sh and sweep-run-registry.sh, and the pre-#7825
#       bare-`kill -0` liveness decision is gone from both
#   (s) `resolve_liveness_pid` never returns a session supervisor (Issue
#       #7825, defect (c)) -- the ancestor walk neither ascends into one nor
#       hands one back as a work-liveness handle
#   (t) an empty `repo_args[@]` (no $LOOM_REPO) never surfaces as a bash-3.2
#       "unbound variable" and never blocks renewal (#8281/#8324)
#   (u) cmd_start's `extra_args[@]` self-invocation is guarded the same way
#       (#8333): with neither --host nor --sweep-id and no daemon-prefixed
#       $LOOM_TERMINAL_ID to auto-resolve from, the array is EMPTY and the
#       detached loop must still renew the lease under bash 3.2 -- plus the
#       populated-array control, which must still forward both flags
#

#          (each attempt for a given <id> is counted in $D/patch-count-<id>,
#          the same counter the body-numbering below already used)
#
#   The 403 files (#6541) let a test drive forge_gh_perm_safe's escalation
#   ladder deterministically: "*-403-once" simulates a transient App-token
#   permission-scope 403 that a fresh mint recovers from; "*-403-always"
#   simulates every rung failing (a fully exhausted ladder). Every attempt
#   -- including escalated retries under a different credential -- reaches
#   this SAME stub (PATH is overridden for the whole test process), so the
#   attempt counters below see every rung, not just the first.
#
#   The stub deliberately distinguishes `-f`/`--raw-field` (real `gh api`
#   semantics: the value is a LITERAL string -- `@-`/`@path` is NOT expanded,
#   stdin is never read) from `-F`/`--field` (real `gh api` semantics: a
#   `@-`/`@path` value IS expanded, reading from stdin/file respectively).
#   This is what catches the `-f body=@-` regression (#6357): with `-f`, the
#   stub records the literal two-character string `@-` as the PATCHed body
#   instead of the piped renewed content -- exactly like the real `gh` CLI --
#   so a script that (incorrectly) uses `-f body=@-` fails test (a) below.
