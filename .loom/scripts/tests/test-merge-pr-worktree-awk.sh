# test-merge-pr-worktree-awk.sh - Regression tests for the porcelain-parsing
# awk helpers in merge-pr.sh (#3671).
#
# Verifies that _find_worktree_by_branch() and _worktree_branch_for() emit
# EXACTLY ONE line for a single matching worktree stanza. Prior to #3671 both
# helpers hit the classic awk `exit`-triggers-`END` gotcha: the blank-line rule
# printed the match and called `exit`, but control transferred to the `END`
# block whose condition was still true, printing the same value a second time.
# The result was a doubled `/path\n/path` string in the post-merge
# worktree-cleanup warning (observed on a consumer repo's PRs, #3671).
#
# The fix adds a `found`-flag guard so `exit` reliably means "already emitted"
# and `END` becomes a no-op once the main body has printed — mirroring the
# correct pattern already used by the --worktree-path validator.
#
# Test strategy:
#   1. Static grep assertions that the live source retains the `!found` guard
#      in both helpers (guards against a regression to the un-guarded awk).
#   2. Behavioral assertions: pipe synthetic multi-stanza `git worktree list
#      --porcelain` blocks through awk bodies that mirror the fixed source and
#      assert exactly-one-line output for:
#        - a match found mid-list (not last stanza) — exercises the
#          `exit`-triggers-`END` path (blank line terminates the stanza).
#        - a match found in the last stanza with NO trailing blank line —
#          exercises the `END`-only path.
#        - no match at all — asserts empty output.
