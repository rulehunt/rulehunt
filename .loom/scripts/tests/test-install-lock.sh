# test-install-lock.sh — per-target install lock regression tests (issue #4928).
#
# Before the fix, nothing in install.sh detected or prevented a SECOND
# installer running against the same target while a first one was mid-flight.
# In the reported incident (2026-08-01) a caller concluded a silent
# `--quick --yes --confirm-reinstall` run had died, restored the target from
# git, and started a second installer — which ran concurrently with the
# still-alive first one. The only thing that serialized them was cargo's
# build-directory lock, by luck; the uninstall-phase deletions of one run and
# the copy phase of the other could just as easily have corrupted the target.
#
# The fix (scripts/install/install-lock.sh) takes a PID-bearing lock file at
# <target>/.loom/.install.lock before any destructive phase of the --quick /
# --clean paths, releases it from an EXIT trap, and reclaims it automatically
# when the recorded PID is no longer alive.
#
# Strategy — two layers:
#   1. Unit tests that source the real helper directly (mirroring
#      test-install-stash-scope.sh) and pin acquire/reclaim/phase/release
#      semantics deterministically, including the cross-host and
#      malformed-lock edge cases.
#   2. End-to-end tests that run the REAL install.sh from a throwaway "fake
#      LOOM_ROOT" (mirroring test-install-full-reinstall-no-target-mutation.sh)
#      and assert that a held lock stops the second installer before it
#      touches the target, that a stale lock does not block, and that the lock
#      is released on both a successful run and an `error()`-triggered exit.
#
# Source-tree-only by design (#6194): scripts/install/install-lock.sh and
# install.sh both live at the repo root, not under defaults/, so neither is
# shipped into an installed consumer repo. This suite SKIPs (exit 0) rather
# than errors when run outside Loom's own checkout.
