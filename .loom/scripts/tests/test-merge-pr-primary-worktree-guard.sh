# test-merge-pr-primary-worktree-guard.sh - Regression test for #3710.
#
# merge-pr.sh's `_remove_loom_worktree` must NEVER attempt to remove the
# primary/main worktree (the FIRST entry of `git worktree list --porcelain`),
# regardless of a .loom-managed sentinel, the checked-out branch, or a
# customized worktree.root.
#
# The bug (Loom 0.12.0, observed in geode-fem): a repo with a customized
# `worktree.root` has its primary checkout at a "non-standard path" relative to
# that root. Merging a PR whose branch was checked out in the primary reached
# the discovery fallback, which found the primary via _find_worktree_by_branch;
# because the primary carried a .loom-managed sentinel, the code called
# `_remove_loom_worktree` on the main working tree. Git fails safe there, but
# the attempt was a logic error and printed a misleading
# "Removing worktree / Could not remove worktree" pair.
#
# Test strategy:
#   1. Static grep assertions that the live source retains the guard (protects
#      against a regression that deletes the guard).
#   2. Behavioral test against a REAL git repo, running the ACTUAL function
#      bodies extracted from merge-pr.sh (no drift): the primary checkout sits
#      at a path that is NOT under a customized worktree.root, carries a
#      .loom-managed sentinel, and has the PR branch checked out. The guard
#      must refuse to remove it and the checkout must survive.
#   3. Control: a genuine SECONDARY Loom-managed worktree IS still removed
#      (the guard is surgical — it only spares the primary).
