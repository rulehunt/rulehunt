# test-reconcile-stack.sh — Regression tests for reconcile-stack.sh (#3776).
#
# Covers the two defects hit live 2026-07-22 when collapsing a stacked-PR stack:
#
#   1. Worktree-checked-out child branch (the blocker). A Loom child branch is
#      ALWAYS checked out in its own managed worktree, and git refuses to rebase
#      a branch checked out in another worktree
#      (`fatal: '<branch>' is already used by worktree at ...`). reconcile-stack.sh
#      must detect that worktree (via `git worktree list`) and run the rebase
#      INSIDE it. Scenario A drives the exact failure and asserts a clean rebase.
#
#   2. False "origin/<parent> still exists" warning on a stale local ref. With
#      delete-branch-on-merge the parent branch is deleted on the remote the
#      instant it merges, but the local refs/remotes/origin/<parent> can linger
#      stale until a prune — a `git show-ref` of that stale ref then false-warns
#      on every post-merge reconcile. The fix queries the remote live via
#      `git ls-remote`. Both scenarios assert the spurious warning is absent.
#
# Strategy: build a real, offline git sandbox (bare "remote" + a clone), stack a
# child on a parent, simulate the parent's squash-merge to the default branch,
# delete the parent branch IN THE BARE REMOTE (leaving the clone's local
# remote-tracking ref stale — the exact #3776 condition), then run the ACTUAL
# defaults/scripts/reconcile-stack.sh with a stubbed `gh` on PATH. No network.
#
#   Scenario A: child branch checked out in a worktree  -> rebase runs there.
#   Scenario B: child branch NOT checked out anywhere    -> in-place fallback.
#
# Since #8583 the planning/execution half of the subject is
# `loom-daemon reconcile-stack` (Rust), reached through this script — so the
# suite needs a BUILT loom-daemon and is wired in the "Native Port Suites" CI
# job rather than shell-suite-tests, which builds no binary. Every assertion
# below predates that port apart from Scenario J and the two rebase-target
# assertions the fix necessarily changed, which is what makes it equivalence
# evidence rather than a restatement of the new implementation.
#
# Usage:
#   cargo build --package loom-daemon
#   ./.loom/scripts/tests/test-reconcile-stack.sh
