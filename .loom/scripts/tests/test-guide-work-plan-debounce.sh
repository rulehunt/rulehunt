# test-guide-work-plan-debounce.sh - Regression test for issues #5890 and #5929
#
# Between 2026-08-10T03:09Z and 2026-08-10T11:10Z, 9 consecutive merged PRs on
# main were all `docs: Guide document maintenance update`, with no
# substantive work merged in between. Root cause: `update_work_plan()`'s only
# write-worthiness gate was "does render_plan_body()'s output differ from the
# committed WORK_PLAN.md region" — true on every `loom:building`/`loom:issue`
# transition on ANY issue, including issues bouncing through Builder-claim ->
# Judge-approve -> Champion merge-risk-hold -> re-claim cycles (observed on
# #5607/#5629). Every bounce manufactured its own docs PR. This mirrors the
# #5643 incident `urgent-flip-guard.sh` fixed for `loom:urgent` specifically,
# but nothing analogous gated the plan-body regeneration itself.
#
# The #5890 fix added a time-based debounce: `update_work_plan()` only writes
# a rewritten body once at least `LOOM_WORK_PLAN_DEBOUNCE_SECS` (default 3600)
# have elapsed since the most recently MERGED docs-maintenance PR, using the
# forge's own merged-PR history as the durable, side-car-free anchor (reusing
# `GUIDE_DOCS_PR_EXCLUDE`, the same "is this a docs-maintenance PR" predicate
# #5454's fix already established).
#
# #5929 BUG, DO NOT REINTRODUCE: that anchor was "time since ANY docs-
# maintenance PR merged", including one whose commit only touched
# WORK_LOG.md and never touched WORK_PLAN.md at all (Step 5 stages
# `WORK_LOG.md WORK_PLAN.md README.md` together, but only files that actually
# changed end up non-empty in the diff). On a repo with sustained merge
# cadence, WORK_LOG-only docs PRs kept landing every 15-40 minutes, which kept
# resetting the debounce clock forever even though WORK_PLAN.md's own content
# had gone stale far longer ago — an overdue rewrite could be suppressed
# indefinitely. The fix anchors the clock to "time since a merged
# docs-maintenance PR's changed files actually included WORK_PLAN.md"
# instead (`last_work_plan_write_epoch()`, renamed from
# `last_docs_pr_merged_epoch()`), which still fully preserves the #5890
# flap-suppression intent.
#
# Verifies that:
#   1. guide.md defines `last_work_plan_write_epoch()`, reusing
#      `GUIDE_DOCS_PR_EXCLUDE` rather than redefining the docs-PR predicate,
#      AND additionally filters merged PRs down to ones whose `files` include
#      `WORK_PLAN.md` (#5929).
#   2. guide.md's `update_work_plan()` gates the write behind
#      `LOOM_WORK_PLAN_DEBOUNCE_SECS` (default 3600) since that write.
#   3. THE REGRESSION, executed rather than grepped: a reconstruction of the
#      debounce arithmetic, run against fixture timelines —
#        a. zero label churn (new_body == old_body) still produces zero
#           writes, unchanged from before #5890.
#        b. a rapid label flip-flop diff, observed inside the debounce
#           window since the last WORK_PLAN.md write, is suppressed (no
#           write).
#        c. the SAME diff, once the debounce window has elapsed, produces
#           exactly one write.
#        d. a diff with no prior WORK_PLAN.md write in history at all
#           (last_merged_epoch == 0) writes immediately — never suppressed
#           by a write that never happened.
#        e. THE #5929 REGRESSION: a diff whose only "recent merge" is a
#           WORK_LOG-only docs PR (no WORK_PLAN.md write) is NOT suppressed,
#           even though a docs-maintenance PR merged within the window —
#           because that merge never touched WORK_PLAN.md, it must not be
#           the anchor at all.
#
# Hermetic: pure grep/arithmetic against fixture epoch values. No forge,
# network, or `gh` calls.
