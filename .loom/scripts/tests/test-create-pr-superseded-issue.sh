# test-create-pr-superseded-issue.sh - Unit tests for create-pr.sh's
# pre-push superseded-target-issue freshness check (#6277).
#
# Two workers racing on the same issue is not caught today until Judge
# review. create-pr.sh now parses the `Closes #N` / `Fixes #N` / `Resolves
# #N` closing-keyword reference out of the PR body and re-verifies the
# target issue's freshness immediately before opening a brand-new PR: if the
# issue is already CLOSED by a different, already-merged PR, it refuses to
# open a duplicate (clear message, non-zero exit, no push, no branch
# deletion). `Part of #N` / `Contributes to #N` partial-increment references
# never match the closing-keyword pattern, so they are exempt by
# construction.
#
# Strategy: run create-pr.sh directly as a subprocess (like
# test-merge-pr-help.sh) with a stub `gh` on PATH and LOOM_FORGE_TYPE=github
# forced (so forge_detect never touches git/network). --head is always
# passed explicitly so the script never needs a real git checkout.
#
# Usage:
#   ./.loom/scripts/tests/test-create-pr-superseded-issue.sh
