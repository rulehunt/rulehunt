# test-docs-only-fast-path.sh - Regression tests for the docs-only fast path
# (#6134): Judge/Champion's mechanical eligibility check that lets a PR whose
# diff is confined to WORK_LOG.md/WORK_PLAN.md/README.md skip the full code
# evaluation + merge-risk judgment cycle, while still landing safely.
#
# Judge's "Docs-Only Fast Path" section and Champion's criterion #2 "Docs-only
# fast path" subsection are prose an LLM instance reads and executes, not a
# standalone script (same situation as test-champion-critical-file-check.sh)
# — so this file mirrors the documented `docs_only_fast_path_check()`
# function in a local copy and pins the shipped markdown's exact commands
# with `assert_doc_contains`, catching drift between the two.
#
# What this asserts:
#   1. The mirrored eligibility check correctly returns ELIGIBLE for diffs
#      confined to any non-empty subset of {WORK_LOG.md, WORK_PLAN.md,
#      README.md}.
#   2. It correctly rejects ANY diff that includes a file outside that exact
#      allowlist — including a nested README.md/WORK_LOG.md (path match, not
#      substring), an empty diff, and the two edge cases the issue's Test
#      Plan calls out explicitly: `.github/workflows/*.yml` and
#      `.loom/config.json` alongside otherwise-docs-only changes.
#   3. Judge's and Champion's shipped markdown both define an identical
#      allowlist and both independently re-derive the file list via the
#      paginated files API (never `gh pr view --json files`, and never by
#      trusting a marker/label).
#   4. Guide's create_docs_pr() emits the informational marker but the
#      shipped Judge/Champion markdown never gates eligibility on it.
#
