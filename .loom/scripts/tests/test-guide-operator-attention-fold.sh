# test-guide-operator-attention-fold.sh - Regression test for issues #5930, #6457
#
# PR #5892 (closing #5890) added a debounce so the *machine-generated* region
# of WORK_PLAN.md (between `<!-- guide:plan-body:start -->` / `:end -->`) is
# only rewritten once per hour even if Ready/Urgent/In-Progress differ. That
# fixed churn from label-bounce regeneration, but WORK_PLAN.md ALSO carried a
# hand-written "Operator Attention: Merge-Risk-Hold Pileup" section ABOVE the
# markers, updated by *appending* a fresh `**Update (... UTC)**:` paragraph
# every tick instead of being rewritten. Each such edit is real content (the
# paragraph text always differs — new timestamp, new prose), so
# `git diff --cached --quiet` in `create_docs_pr()` always found something to
# commit — the #5890 debounce never even ran for this case, since it only
# ever guarded `render_plan_body()`'s output. Net effect: ~30
# "docs: Guide document maintenance update" PRs merged in one day, driven
# almost entirely by this ever-growing narrative section.
#
# The fix folds the section INTO `render_plan_body()` as its first generated
# subsection (deterministically rendered from current `loom:operator` PR
# membership, no timestamps or freeform prose), so it rides the SAME
# byte-for-byte `new_body == old_body` comparison and the SAME
# `LOOM_WORK_PLAN_DEBOUNCE_SECS` gate as every other section — no separate
# mechanism, and nothing left to hand-append to.
#
# Verifies that:
#   1. guide.md's render_plan_body() queries `loom:operator` PRs into a
#      `held` variable and renders an "Operator Attention: Merge-Risk-Hold
#      Pileup" section from it, as the FIRST section emitted (ahead of
#      "Urgent") — so it is exactly as (non-)volatile as everything else in
#      the generated region.
#   2. guide.md explicitly documents the fix and prohibits reintroducing a
#      hand-appended narrative paragraph (the #5930 regression marker).
#   3. The committed WORK_PLAN.md carries the section INSIDE the markers, not
#      above them, and contains no leftover `**Update (` append-log residue
#      above the markers.
#   4. THE REGRESSION, executed rather than grepped: a reconstruction of the
#      section's render function, run twice against the SAME `loom:operator`
#      PR membership, produces byte-identical output — i.e. a tick where the
#      underlying facts (which PRs are held) have not changed can never
#      manufacture a diff, regardless of when it runs.
#   5. #6457: `$held` is derived FROM `$approved`'s already-fetched PR list
#      (filtered on `loom:operator` label membership) rather than issuing a
#      second, independently-cached/independently-search-indexed
#      `gh pr list --label "loom:operator"` query — so the "Operator
#      Attention" and "Approved (Awaiting Merge)" sections (and the Backlog
#      Balance count derived from `$held`) can no longer disagree about
#      which open `loom:pr` PRs also carry `loom:operator`, even under
#      cache-age skew or GitHub search-index lag on a just-applied label.
#
# Hermetic: pure grep/string reconstruction against fixture data. No forge,
# network, or `gh` calls.
