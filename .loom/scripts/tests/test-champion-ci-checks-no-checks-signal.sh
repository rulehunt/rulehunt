# test-champion-ci-checks-no-checks-signal.sh - Regression tests for #6211:
# Champion's "no CI checks" merge-gate read couldn't distinguish genuine
# no-checks from a transient `gh pr checks` failure.
#
# Champion's criterion #6 ("CI Status Check") in `champion-pr-merge.md` is
# prose an LLM instance reads and executes, not a standalone script (same
# situation as test-champion-critical-file-check.sh) — so this file mirrors
# the documented `read_ci_checks()` helper in a local function and pins the
# shipped markdown's exact commands with `assert_doc_contains`, catching
# drift between the two.
#
# Bug recap (#6211, follow-up from #6169/PR #6212): both criterion #6 and
# the pre-merge-comment CI-status gather step treated ANY empty stdout from
# `gh pr checks --json bucket,name` as proof "no CI checks are configured
# for this PR" and therefore safe to auto-merge (`CHECKS=$(gh pr checks
# <number> --json bucket,name 2>/dev/null)`, stderr discarded, exit code
# never inspected). But `gh pr checks` can ALSO return empty stdout during a
# transient forge failure (e.g. the intermittent TLS handshake error #6169
# hit, observed ~1 call in 3 on one host) — indistinguishable from genuine
# "no checks configured" once stderr is thrown away. Since this is
# Champion's auto-merge gate, that ambiguity is a real false-positive path.
#
# Fix: `read_ci_checks()` only trusts "no checks" (NO_CHECKS="true") when it
# observes the DOCUMENTED genuine-no-checks signature -- empty stdout,
# nonzero exit, and stderr containing "no checks reported". Any other empty
# read is ambiguous, retried once, and if still ambiguous fails CLOSED
# (NO_CHECKS="unknown") rather than being trusted as "no checks". The
# genuine no-checks case is resolved on the FIRST read (no artificial wait
# for the common checkless-repo case); only an ambiguous read pays the one
# retry.
#
# This file asserts:
#   1. A confirmed genuine no-checks read (empty stdout, nonzero exit,
#      matching stderr) resolves to NO_CHECKS="true" on the first attempt --
#      no retry, no artificial wait.
#   2. A one-off ambiguous empty read (transient failure shape) that clears
#      on retry resolves to NO_CHECKS="false" with the real checks from the
#      retry -- and gh was called exactly twice.
#   3. An ambiguous empty read that persists through the retry resolves to
#      NO_CHECKS="unknown" (fail closed), not "true" -- the exact false
#      positive #6211 reports.
#   4. Real checks on the first read resolve to NO_CHECKS="false" with zero
#      retries (regression guard: the common healthy case is unaffected).
#   5. The shipped markdown in champion-pr-merge.md and
#      champion-reference.md carries the fixed `read_ci_checks()` logic and
#      no longer contains the old blanket-empty-stdout detection.
