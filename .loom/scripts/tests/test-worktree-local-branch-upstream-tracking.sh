# test-worktree-local-branch-upstream-tracking.sh — Tests for correcting a
# pre-existing local branch's upstream on the worktree.sh reuse path (#6095)
#
# Regression coverage for the incident on #6086/PR #6093: a builder worktree's
# local `feature/issue-N` branch was checked out but its upstream tracking ref
# had somehow been set to `origin/main` instead of `origin/feature/issue-N`.
# A `git pull --ff-only` then silently fast-forwarded the local branch to
# main's tip, diverging it from the PR's actual head.
#
# Root cause: the "Check if branch already exists" reuse path in worktree.sh
# (`if git show-ref --verify --quiet "refs/heads/$BRANCH_NAME"`) reused the
# existing local branch by name only — it never inspected or corrected that
# branch's upstream tracking ref before handing it to `git worktree add`.
# This is unlike the sibling "no local branch, but origin/$BRANCH_NAME
# exists" path (#4823, covered by test-worktree-remote-branch-tracking.sh),
# which explicitly creates the local branch tracking the remote one — that
# path only runs when the local branch does NOT already exist, so it never
# fired for a worktree whose local branch pre-existed from an earlier
# Builder pass.
#
# Coverage:
#   1. Local branch exists with its upstream mis-set to origin/main (and
#      origin/feature/issue-N has diverged, carrying a commit the local
#      branch doesn't have — matching the observed incident shape):
#      worktree.sh corrects the upstream to origin/feature/issue-N.
#   2. Local branch exists with NO upstream configured at all, and
#      origin/feature/issue-N exists: worktree.sh sets the upstream to
#      origin/feature/issue-N (does not leave it unset).
#   3. Local branch exists, already correctly tracking
#      origin/feature/issue-N: worktree.sh leaves it unchanged (no-op,
#      regression guard against accidentally breaking the correct case).
#   4. Local branch exists, was NEVER pushed (no origin/feature/issue-N at
#      all): worktree.sh leaves tracking exactly as it was (does not
#      fabricate an upstream that doesn't exist).
#
# Pattern follows test-worktree-remote-branch-tracking.sh: throwaway bare
# origin + repo in a mktemp dir, copy worktree.sh + lib/, run, assert on
# `git branch -vv` / `@{u}` output.
