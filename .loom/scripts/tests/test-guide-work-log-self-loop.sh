# test-guide-work-log-self-loop.sh - Regression test for issue #5454
#
# The Guide role's Document Maintenance phase self-perpetuated: `update_work_log()`
# built its "new merged PRs" set from `gh pr list --state merged` with NO exclusion
# for the phase's own `docs: Guide document maintenance update` PRs. Since every
# docs-maintenance PR is itself a merged PR, merging PR N always produced "new
# content above the watermark" for tick N+1 — the "nothing new, skip" branch could
# never be true two ticks in a row, and the phase emitted a fresh PR forever
# (observed: 23 self-referential PRs, one every ~15-30 min).
#
# The fix is a jq exclusion applied BEFORE `new_prs` is computed, matching either
# the `docs/guide-update` head-branch prefix (the branch docs-worktree.sh creates,
# and the same prefix Step 1's open-docs-PR guard searches on) or the exact title
# `create_docs_pr` passes to `gh pr create`.
#
# Verifies that:
#   1. guide.md still defines the single-line GUIDE_DOCS_PR_EXCLUDE expression
#      and applies it inside update_work_log()'s `new_prs` query, with
#      `headRefName` requested from `gh --json` (jq cannot filter a field gh was
#      not asked to return).
#   2. THE REGRESSION, executed rather than grepped: the expression extracted
#      verbatim FROM guide.md, run through the real jq pipeline, drops docs PRs
#      (by branch and by title) and keeps genuine work PRs.
#   3. Two consecutive ticks whose only merged PR above the watermark is a prior
#      docs PR both yield an empty `new_prs` — i.e. the second tick produces no
#      PR, which is the loop-termination property #5454 is about.
#   4. A tick with BOTH a genuine PR and a prior docs PR still logs the genuine
#      one (the filter excludes docs PRs, not everything).
#   5. The watermark helper `work_log_max_pr` reads back only what was written,
#      so an excluded docs PR never advances it — and is re-filtered next tick.
#
# Hermetic: pure jq/grep against a temp dir. No forge, network, or `gh` calls.
