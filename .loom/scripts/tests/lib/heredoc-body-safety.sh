# heredoc-body-safety.sh — shared STATIC scan for the #7508 bash-3.2
# heredoc-in-command-substitution parser trap, used by the watchdog test
# suite (test-loom-daemon-watchdog.sh).
#
# The trap (#7508): wrapping a heredoc in `$(...)` makes bash 3.2 (macOS's
# stock, pre-GPLv3 /bin/bash) mis-track quoting THROUGH the heredoc body while
# its lexer textually scans for the closing `)`. A bare apostrophe anywhere in
# the body, or a `#` sharing a physical line with a backtick, is then misread
# as opening a region it can never close — `bad substitution: no closing )` /
# `unexpected EOF`, and an empty body. `read -r -d '' var <<EOF` reads the
# heredoc with no `$(...)` wrapper at all and never enters that scan, so it is
# safe whatever punctuation the prose contains.
#
# Why this file exists (#7834): the scan started life inline in
# test-loom-daemon-watchdog.sh, where it sliced the body with an awk pattern
# that only matched openers ENDING in `<<EOF`. The #7508 fix had already moved
# escalate_peer_coordination_degraded() to `IFS= read -r -d '' body <<EOF ||
# true` — the line ends in `|| true`, the pattern never fired, the slice came
# back EMPTY, and both of that function's assertions passed VACUOUSLY. Two
# properties here are the structural fix for that whole class:
#
#   1. Opener detection is shape-agnostic (anything after `<<EOF` is fine), and
#   2. an empty slice is a HARD FAILURE, never a silent pass — so a future
#      opener shape this scan does not know about fails loudly instead of
#      quietly disabling the check.
#
# Why the prose rules are scoped by construction rather than applied to every
# body: the two trigger shapes are only dangerous inside the `$(...)` wrapper.
# Demanding trigger-free prose from a `read -d ''` body constrains ordinary
# alert text (every "`foo` (#1234)" reference is a backtick+`#` line) to dodge
# a bug that construction cannot hit, and a failure message claiming it
# "reintroduces the bash-3.2 parse trap" would simply be false. Instead a
# `read -d ''` body must prove its CONSTRUCTION, and a body that regresses to
# `$(cat <<EOF` is reclassified and gets the strict prose rules applied to it
# at that moment — which is exactly when they start to matter.
#
# Sourced, not executed. The caller provides pass()/fail().

# heredoc_func_body <file> <fn>
