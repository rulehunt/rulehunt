# Source this file (do not exec). Extracted so the two suites build identical
# fixtures from ONE definition: a fake `gh` that drifts from the real one in
# only one of them is a test that proves nothing, and that is exactly the class
# of bug #7977 hit (the stub emitted post-`--jq` scalars, indistinguishable
# from real `gh` only because every caller passed `--jq`).
#
# Required globals, set by the sourcing suite BEFORE sourcing:
#   LOOM_REPO_ROOT      repo root, for locating the real sources these fake
#   CLI_DIR             defaults/scripts/cli, for START_SCRIPT-adjacent copies
#   START_SCRIPT        the real loom-daemon-start.sh a fixture may copy

# `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` is read when set and is optional.
#
# WHICH BINARY IMPLEMENTS THE STUB (#8134, epic #7810 / #8087)
#
# Every fixture below copies the REAL loom-daemon-start.sh, which since #8087 is
# a thin stub over `loom-daemon daemon-start`. The restart / --relaunch /
# full-update flows exec it, so the suites only test what they think they do if
# that stub execs the binary built from this working tree.
#
# `--self-only` is mandatory and is exactly the case that flag exists for: every
# fixture pins $LOOM_DAEMON_BIN to a FAKE daemon binary, because that is the
# daemon the update flow BUILDS, PROVISIONS and RESTARTS, and whose inherited
# autonomy env the assertions read back. Exporting it as the implementation too
# would make the stub exec the fake as itself and no start would ever happen.
#
# Pinned HERE rather than in each suite because all three consumers
# (test-loom-daemon-update.sh, its -fetch and -resolve-json siblings) build
# fixtures from this one definition, and a pin present in only some of them is
# the drift this file was extracted to prevent. Guarded so re-sourcing is a
# no-op. This is a HARNESS change, not an assertion change (#8011 /
# verification-recipes.md §6): no expectation in any consumer suite moved.

# SCRATCH-ROOT CONTAINMENT (#8712)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# THE INCIDENT. A fleet host's checkout was found with a 472-byte bash fake —
# this file's own `fake loom-daemon: unsupported subcommand` stub — sitting at
# `loom-daemon/target/release/loom-daemon`, the canonical build-output path.
# `loom-daemon-update.sh --fetch` resolves the binary that IMPLEMENTS
# `release-fetch` by preferring a repo-local build, got the fake, and every
# `auto_update` fetch on that host failed for hours while the machine-level
# install it was trying to update sat there working.
#
# HOW A FIXTURE CAN REACH A REAL PATH AT ALL. Every fixture below is handed an
# explicit path under the suite's `mktemp -d`, so the direct writers are safe by
# construction. The one that computes its destination at RUN time is the fake
# `cargo` (`write_fake_cargo`): it writes `${CARGO_TARGET_DIR:-target}/release/
# loom-daemon` relative to ITS OWN CWD, and that cwd is whatever
# `loom-daemon-update.sh` resolved as `$REPO_ROOT/loom-daemon` — normally the
# fixture, but the script has documented fallbacks (`$PWD` resolves no checkout
# ⇒ the script's OWN checkout, #5140; `LOOM_MACHINE_CHECKOUT`, #4229) under
# which that is a REAL checkout while a fake `cargo` is still first on `$PATH`.
# That is the poisoning path, and it needs no test bug to fire — only a host
# condition that makes a fixture's `$PWD` stop resolving as a checkout.
#
# THE GUARD. A suite declares its scratch root once (`loom_fixture_scratch_root
# "$BASE_WORKDIR"`), which both records it here and EXPORTS it so the generated
# fake `cargo` — a separate process, spawned later — enforces the same rule.
# Any fixture write outside it aborts loudly instead of landing on a real path.
# Containment, not cleanup: it holds on failure and on interruption alike,
# because the write never happens rather than being undone afterwards.
#
# Declaring it is optional (unset ⇒ no containment, byte-identical behaviour)
# so an unrelated suite can source this file without adopting the discipline.

# write_fake_daemon / write_fake_codesign* / write_fake_cosign* -- moved here
# from test-loom-daemon-update.sh by #8028 (epic #7810 PR 6a) when the
# artifact-fetch scenarios (tests A-V) split into the sibling suite
# test-loom-daemon-update-fetch.sh: write_fake_daemon is used by BOTH suites
# (every fetch scenario provisions an "installed" binary with it), and the
# codesign/cosign fixtures are needed only by the fetch sibling but belong
# beside the other fake-forge fixtures rather than duplicated into a suite of
# their own.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Writes a fake daemon binary at $1 that reports commit $2 on --version and,
# on a normal run, appends its inherited LOOM_WORK_FINDER / LOOM_MAIN_HEALTH_GATE
# to marker file $3 before looping forever (so it stays alive for kill -0).
#
# `calibrate` is handled explicitly (#4799) and exits immediately with no
# output: this fixture has no real calibrate implementation, and every
# successful loom-daemon-start.sh run (nohup/launchd/systemd, all three
# reached by this suite's restart scenarios) calls `$DAEMON_BIN calibrate
# --workspace ... --json` via print_calibrate_hint(). Before this fix, that
# call fell through to the `while true` loop below and hung forever inside
# print_calibrate_hint()'s blocking `$(...)` -- the exact hang
# ci-excluded.txt documented. print_calibrate_hint() is bounded independently
# now (lib/bounded-run.sh), but this fixture also short-circuits so the suite
# stays fast rather than eating that timeout on every restart.
#
# GENERALIZED (#4799 CI hang): `calibrate` was only one instance of a whole
# CLASS of wedge. ANY *subcommand* the lifecycle scripts dispatch that this
# fixture does not recognize used to fall through to the `while true` daemon
# body IN THE FOREGROUND and block its caller forever -- which is precisely how
# the CI run hung: with a real `systemctl --user` reachable, the update script
# resolved DAEMON_MANAGER=systemd and ran `"$PROVISION_TARGET" restart`, and
# this fixture (no `restart` handler) looped instead of answering. So the
# catch-all below exits non-zero for any unrecognized NON-FLAG first argument
# (a real daemon rejects an unknown subcommand; it does not daemonize). A
# leading `-`/`--` still falls through to the daemon body, because the
# supervisors DO launch the daemon proper with flags.
