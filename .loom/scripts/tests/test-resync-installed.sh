# test-resync-installed.sh - Smoke tests for resync-installed.sh (#3777, #4239)
#
# This file deliberately embeds a literal conflict-marker fixture (the #6162
# pre-resync syntax-gate case), so it opts itself out of
# check-conflict-markers.sh (#6499) with that script's in-file sentinel:
# check-conflict-markers:allow
#
# Constructs throwaway git repos with synthetic defaults/ and installed .loom/
# trees so it can deterministically exercise the load-bearing cases:
#   (a) already in sync     -> exit 0, "Already in sync", no writes
#   (b) drift (differing)   -> file rewritten to match defaults/, exit 0
#   (c) missing installed   -> file created from defaults/, exit 0
#   (d) --dry-run + drift    -> exit 2, installed file UNCHANGED
#   (e) --dry-run + in sync -> exit 0
#   (f) repo-specific file   -> file present only in .loom/ left untouched
#   (g) .loom/resync-ignore  -> pinned file reported "skipped", not overwritten
#   (g2) .loom/resync-ignore honors the repo-relative pin spelling, e.g.
#        ".loom/hooks/foo.sh" or "./.loom/hooks/foo.sh" pinning the same file
#        as the ".loom/"-relative "hooks/foo.sh" form (#6515)
#   (g3) a .loom/resync-ignore pin matching nothing this run (typo, or a
#        retired file) is reported as "pin had no effect", with a "did you
#        mean" hint when a walked file shares its basename (#6515)
#   (h) idempotent rerun     -> second run reports all unchanged
# Widened surfaces (#4239):
#   (i) drift in each new surface (roles/docs/bin/commands) -> updated + exit 2 on dry-run
#   (j) local-only custom role -> survives untouched
#   (k) resync-ignore pins a new-surface file -> reported "skipped"
#   (l) symlinked install target -> skipped, not clobbered
#   (l2) symlinked SOURCE file -> resolved to its content (not a copied link),
#        appears in the per-file report (updated/unchanged), destination-side
#        symlink protection (l) is unaffected (#5222)
#   (m) recorded loom_source gone -> clear error, exit 1
#   (n) metadata re-stamp -> loom_version/loom_commit/last_resync present after apply
#   (#6032) re-stamp also STRIPS a legacy loom_source field, on both the jq
#       and (jq-unavailable) python3 fallback code paths; a fixture with no
#       loom_source field to begin with is a no-op (none is added)
# Canonical-guard-defer (#4041, #4403, #4566):
#   (o) canonical guard + git-TRACKED vendored guard -> preserved, tree clean, and
#       reported as an informational note (NOT a WARN) that --quiet suppresses
#   (p) canonical guard + UNTRACKED vendored guard   -> removed (unchanged behavior)
# Worktree-isolation refusal (#4563):
#   (q) invoked from a linked worktree -> non-zero exit, NOTHING written to main
#   (r) --allow-worktree / LOOM_RESYNC_ALLOW_WORKTREE=1 -> permitted (warns)
#   (s) main checkout (incl. a subdirectory of it)      -> unaffected, exit 0
# Self-update safety (#4669):
#   (t) the REAL script, installed as a padded "older" copy, resyncs itself from
#       a substantially different newer source -> run completes, no mid-run
#       syntax error, self-copy applied LAST, other surfaces fully refreshed
#   (u) an updated file gets a new inode (staged + renamed, not truncated) with
#       its permissions preserved, and leaves no .resync-stage.* dirt
#   (v) an unsyncable file -> explicit PARTIAL REFRESH report + exit 1
# Retired payload files (#5981):
#   (x) a file listed in defaults/.loom-retired.list but with no defaults/
#       counterpart is REMOVED from the installed tree and reported with the
#       "removed" verb; --dry-run previews it (exit 2, "would remove") without
#       deleting; .loom/resync-ignore can pin it against removal exactly like
#       an update; a retired entry with no installed counterpart is a no-op
# Untracked-.loom/-path remedy classification (#5983, #6613):
#   (y) an untracked-and-unignored path under a pure-copy surface
#       (.loom/hooks|scripts|roles|docs|runtimes|bin/) that still exists under
#       defaults/ today is shipped payload -> audit_untracked_loom_paths()
#       recommends committing it directly, not adding it to EPHEMERAL_PATTERNS
#       and not the #6613 retired-file remedy either
#   (z) an untracked-and-unignored path outside any pure-copy surface is
#       genuine runtime state -> the existing EPHEMERAL_PATTERNS remedy is
#       unchanged
#   a path matching the pure-copy-surface PATTERN but with no defaults/
#       counterpart today (removed from defaults/ without a
#       defaults/.loom-retired.list entry) gets a third, distinct remedy
#       naming defaults/.loom-retired.list -- neither "commit them" nor
#       EPHEMERAL_PATTERNS
# Crash-detection marker (#5980):
#   a successful apply leaves no .loom/.resync-in-progress marker behind;
#   --dry-run never writes one; a leftover marker (simulating a crashed prior
#   run) is reported by BOTH --dry-run (untouched, pure detector) and a real
#   apply (which then restarts from scratch, idempotently, and clears the
#   marker on full success); a PARTIAL refresh leaves the marker in place
#   (recording the real target version + a timestamp/pid) until a later
#   successful retry clears it.
# Output-dir staging mode (#6106):
#   --output <dir> resyncs into a disposable, DETACHED `git worktree` instead
#   of the invoking repo's own checkout: the invoking repo (main OR a linked
#   worktree) is left completely unwritten, <dir> is a real independent git
#   checkout that actually received the resync (including files the invoking
#   repo never had), --output is permitted from a linked worktree (unlike a
#   bare run, #4563), an already-existing <dir> is refused, --dry-run +
#   --output leaves no staging worktree or dangling worktree registration
#   behind, LOOM_RESYNC_OUTPUT=<dir> is equivalent to the flag, and --output
#   with no value exits 1.
# Plus contract checks:
#   - --help prints usage (documenting --allow-worktree and --output), exit 0
#   - unknown arg exits 1
#   - not-a-git-repo exits 1
#
# Usage:

# unrelated bare top-level rel via the #6515 normalization -------------------
# ".loom/package.json" is a nonsensical pin (there is no file at that path --
# the root package.json's is_ignored() rel is the bare "package.json"), but
# the #6515 repo-relative normalization would otherwise strip its ".loom/"
# prefix down to "package.json" and silently match the unrelated root file
# anyway. That is exactly the class of silent-pin-misfire bug this PR exists
# to eliminate, just reintroduced by the fix's own normalization (flagged in
# Judge review: a sibling PR adds an analogous bare "CLAUDE.md" rel for the
# root guide, which would collide with a ".loom/CLAUDE.md" pin the same way).
