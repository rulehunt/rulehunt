# test-install-stash-scope.sh — regression tests for the reinstall stash guard
# scoping (issue #3597; issue #5289 added tests 4-5; issue #6196 added tests
# 6-7).
#
# The `--quick` reinstall (install.sh) and `--clean` install (install-loom.sh)
# guards used to run an unscoped `git stash push`, sweeping sibling installers'
# uncommitted tracked changes into the stash and leaving a half-old/half-new
# hybrid tree. The fix scopes the stash to the intersection of the dirty set
# with Loom's ownership set (manifest paths + .gitignore + CLAUDE.md) via
# scripts/install/stash-scope.sh::_emit_loom_owned_dirty_paths.
#
# Strategy: source the real helper against a temp git repo seeded with both a
# Loom-owned file and a sibling (non-Loom) file, dirty both, and assert:
#   1. the helper lists ONLY the Loom-owned dirty path,
#   2. a pathspec-scoped `git stash push` leaves the sibling change untouched
#      in the working tree and absent from the stash,
#   3. a tree dirty with ONLY sibling changes yields no owned-dirty paths
#      (callers skip the stash entirely),
#   4. root CLAUDE.md carries the same explicit ownership-set carve-out
#      `.gitignore` already has (issue #5289 — CLAUDE.md's Loom section is
#      synthesized at install time, not copied from a literal defaults/
#      file, so the manifest walk alone never lists it),
#   5. a dirty root CLAUDE.md is actually selected for stashing by
#      `_emit_loom_owned_dirty_paths` (the property the reinstall's
#      in-block-edit conflict guard at install.sh:~1290 depends on).
#
# Source-tree-only by design (#6194): scripts/install/stash-scope.sh lives at
# the repo root, not under defaults/, so it is never shipped into an
# installed consumer repo. This suite SKIPs (exit 0) rather than errors when
# run outside Loom's own checkout.
#
# Usage:
#   bash defaults/scripts/tests/test-install-stash-scope.sh
