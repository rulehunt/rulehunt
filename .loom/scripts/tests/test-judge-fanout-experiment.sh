# test-judge-fanout-experiment.sh — tests for the #3739/#3748 Judge fan-out
# experiment artifacts.
#
# Covers everything testable WITHOUT the Workflow tool (which a builder/CI does
# not have):
#   1. judge-fanout-workflow.js is syntactically loadable (compile-only via the
#      same vm.Script wrap-and-never-execute pattern the gate uses), including
#      the #3748 hardened prompts + No-Fable-Judge guard.
#   2. judge-fanout-experiment.sh with the flag UNSET is a strict no-op: exit 0,
#      no dispatch, and it writes no files.
#   3. judge-fanout-experiment.sh with the flag SET syntax-checks both the
#      workflow and the corpus-runner scaffold and still runs no live judge.
#   4. The corpus-runner scaffold's non-Workflow-tool logic (arg validation,
#      results-table emission) runs and produces the expected shape — without
#      ever invoking the Workflow tool (a stub `gh` provides the diff).
#
# Usage:
#   bash defaults/scripts/tests/test-judge-fanout-experiment.sh
