# test-sweep-lease-fence.sh - Unit tests for sweep-lease-fence.sh (#6309,
# Epic #6165 Phase 3: sweep-side fencing before push / PR-open).
#
# Black-box tests: sweep-lease-fence.sh is a full CLI script (no functions to
# source), so `gh` is stubbed on PATH (real `jq` is used unstubbed to apply
# the script's own `--jq` filter against a canned comments fixture, exactly
# the way real `gh api --jq` would) and the real script is invoked as a
# subprocess, asserting on stdout/stderr/exit code. Mirrors the stubbing
# pattern in test-sweep-lease-renew.sh (#6180).
#
# Covers:
#   (a) fresh lease owned by this sweep's own host -> PASS (exit 0)
#   (b) expired lease, owned by THIS sweep's own host -> ABORT EXPIRED (exit 3)
#   (c) fresh lease owned by a DIFFERENT host -> ABORT SUPERSEDED (exit 4)
#   (r) expired lease owned by a DIFFERENT host (an abandoned, never-yielded
#       peer lease, #6783) -> PASS, not ABORT (exit 0) -- distinguishes this
#       from (b): only an EXPIRED lease that is also THIS sweep's OWN aborts
#   (d) no lease comment at all -> PASS, fail-open (exit 0)
#   (e) a lease comment whose marker fails to parse -> PASS, fail-open
#   (f) a `gh api` fetch failure -> PASS, fail-open
#   (g) TTL boundary: age exactly == ttl -> PASS (not-yet-expired, matches
#       lease_is_fresh's `age_minutes < ttl_minutes` strict-inequality
#       contract in claim_reconciliation.rs)
#   (h) picks the FRESHEST among multiple lease comments, not merely the
#       first or last in fixture order
#   (i) --host defaults to LOOM_HOST_ID's raw value when
#       LOOM_LEASE_PUBLISH_HOSTNAME opts into raw publishing (#6322)
#   (j) --ttl-minutes overrides the default TTL
#   (k) usage errors: bad issue number, unknown flag, non-numeric
#       --ttl-minutes, unknown command
#   (l) --help / bogus-command contract checks
#   (m) default (no opt-in) --host resolution is the OPAQUE id of
#       LOOM_HOST_ID, not the raw value (#6322)
#   (n) a lease comment carrying the raw hostname no longer matches the
#       opaque default resolution -> ABORT SUPERSEDED (#6322)
#   (o) a yielded (host, sweep)'s lease is excluded from "freshest" and the
#       check falls back to the next-freshest, non-yielded lease (#6485)
#   (p) every lease comment on the issue has yielded -> PASS, fail-open
#   (q) a yield record for a DIFFERENT sweep on the SAME host does not
#       exclude a later, legitimately-reclaimed lease from that host --
#       matched by exact (host, sweep), not by host alone (#6485)
#   (s) LOOM_REPO unset (the common case -- this script has no --repo CLI
#       flag) leaves `repo_args` a genuinely empty array; expanding
#       `"${repo_args[@]}"` unguarded there is an "unbound variable" under
#       `set -u` on bash < 4.4 (macOS system bash 3.2), which silently
#       corrupts the comments fetch into the unrelated fail-open path
#       instead of actually evaluating the real lease (#7957). Asserted on
#       the ambient bash always, and again under a real 3.x /bin/bash when
#       one is present on the host (skipped, not failed, elsewhere).
