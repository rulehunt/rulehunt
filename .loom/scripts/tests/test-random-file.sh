# test-random-file.sh — Regression tests for random-file.sh's gitignore
# handling (#6537).
#
# random-file.sh used to filter .gitignore patterns with a hand-rolled
# glob-to-regex parser (gitignore_to_regex() / filter_by_gitignore()) that
# diverged from real gitignore semantics in two ways:
#   1. A top-level directory pattern (e.g. `build/`) did not reliably exclude
#      files inside it.
#   2. `!`-negation re-inclusion lines were silently dropped.
#
# The fix replaces the hand-rolled parser with git-native handling: `fd`
# keeps its own native gitignore support (no more --no-ignore-vcs), and the
# `find` fallback path uses `git ls-files --cached --others --exclude-standard`
# / `git check-ignore` instead of a regex reimplementation.
#
# Coverage:
#   1. A top-level ignored directory's file is never selected (find fallback).
#   2. A `!`-negated re-inclusion is selected while its blanket exclusion
#      sibling is not (find fallback).
#   3. Same two cases again via the `fd` fast path, when `fd`/`fdfind` is
#      available on the host (skipped otherwise — this is exercising a
#      genuinely different code path, not a duplicate assertion).
#   4. No .gitignore present -> all files are still discoverable (regression
#      guard against the git-native path silently returning nothing).
#   5. Not inside a git repository -> falls back to plain `find` without
#      erroring.
#
# Pattern follows test-default-branch.sh: throwaway repo in a mktemp dir,
# copy the script under test, run it directly (no network, no forge).
