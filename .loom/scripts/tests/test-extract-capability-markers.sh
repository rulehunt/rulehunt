# test-extract-capability-markers.sh - tests for extract-capability-markers.sh,
# the reference parser for the `<!-- loom:capability=<name> -->` convention
# (#6892).
#
# Covers: no-marker (exit 1), single/multiple valid markers (exit 0,
# deduped+sorted), the `cloud-profile:<name>` prefix family, unknown values
# failing closed (exit 2, named on stderr, excluded from stdout), a mix of
# valid + unknown values, duplicate markers deduping, and the #4840-style
# false-positive guard (prose that quotes the marker syntax as literal
# example text must not be mistaken for a live marker).
#
# Usage:
#   ./defaults/scripts/tests/test-extract-capability-markers.sh
