# test-version-check-gate-callsites.sh - Structural regression guard over
# EVERY documented/scripted recipe that rebases a branch and pushes directly
# (never through create-pr.sh, so create-pr.sh's own gate at PR-creation
# time never sees the push) -- each must call the shared
# defaults/scripts/version-check-gate.sh before its `git push --force-with-lease`.
#
# Background (#7168, #7171, #7341): `create-pr.sh` gates version-bearing-file
# sync (VERSION/CLAUDE.md/Cargo.lock/.../.loom/install-metadata.json) once,
# at PR-creation time (#6730). That gate never sees a rebase performed AFTER
# a PR already exists, because those recipes push directly. #7171 closed the
# gap for Doctor's two merge-conflict rebase recipes and
# rebase-stacked-children.sh. #7341 found the SAME gap in three more call
# sites that also rebase + `git push --force-with-lease` directly:
# reconcile-stack.sh (`rebase --onto`, the stacked-PR post-merge collapse),
# three separate recipes in judge.md (Judge's own DIRTY/BEHIND/simple-
# conflict auto-rebase-and-push paths), one in builder-worktree.md
# (a Builder rebasing an already-open PR branch outside create-pr.sh), and
# doctor.md's own Step 9 pre-push head-SHA-recheck recovery (the "rebase onto
# the new head, then push --force-with-lease" rows, which #7171 missed because
# it only gated doctor.md's two merge-conflict recipes). Left
# ungated, a rebase can silently absorb origin/main's own version-bearing
# values into every file EXCEPT one the branch's own commits never touched
# (in practice .loom/install-metadata.json, since it never raises a git
# conflict) -- invisible until CI's "Installer Integration Tests" fails, or
# (per #7341's own investigation) an agent "recovers" by hand-patching the
# version-bearing files directly instead of running
# `./scripts/version.sh set <version>`, missing install-metadata.json all
# over again.
#
# This suite does NOT re-test version-check-gate.sh's own pass/fail logic
# (see test-version-check-gate.sh) or reconcile-stack.sh's specific gate
# BEHAVIOR (see test-reconcile-stack.sh Scenarios E/F) or
# rebase-stacked-children.sh's (see test-rebase-stacked-children.sh). It is a
# pure structural guard: grep every known rebase-then-push call site for the
# gate invocation, so a future refactor that silently drops one call site
# fails loudly here instead of resurfacing as a THIRD/FOURTH occurrence of
# this exact incident.
#
# Usage:
#   ./.loom/scripts/tests/test-version-check-gate-callsites.sh
