# test-check-ci-status.sh - Unit tests for check-ci-status.sh's workflow-run
# fold-in (issue #5495) and per-job status filter (issue #5748).
#
# Bug (#5495): analyze_status() only ever iterated over check-runs the Checks
# API already knows about. A workflow_run that is still `queued` (no jobs
# dispatched yet, so zero check-runs exist for it) was completely invisible
# to the pending count. If a handful of OTHER, faster/independent workflows
# for the same commit had already completed successfully,
# `success > 0 && pending == 0` was satisfied and the script reported
# overall "success" even though the primary CI workflow hadn't run a single
# job -- exactly the incident reproduced on commit
# 96c2b8246403c9c91d37c2c7d6eebf7558f790f4 in the issue (4 unrelated
# already-completed checks satisfied success>0/pending==0 while the "CI"
# workflow_run sat `pending` with zero jobs for 3+ minutes).
#
# Feature (#5748): --job "<name>" reports one named check-run's own
# status/conclusion instead of the aggregate across all checks, so a caller
# without docker locally (e.g. Auditor) can still look up the real
# forge-reported outcome of a docker-dependent CI leg like
# worker-image-smoke ("loom-worker Image Smoke Test").
#
# check-ci-status.sh is a full CLI script (not sourced functions), so this
# is a black-box test: stub `gh` on PATH (mirrors test-check-duplicate.sh's
# convention) and invoke the real script as a subprocess, asserting on
# stdout/exit code. `LOOM_FORGE_TYPE=github` short-circuits forge_detect()
# before it ever touches the config-resolver tier chain or `git remote`, so
# no `git` stub is needed; every test passes an explicit `--commit`, so
# `git rev-parse HEAD` is never invoked either.
#
# Usage:
#   ./.loom/scripts/tests/test-check-ci-status.sh
