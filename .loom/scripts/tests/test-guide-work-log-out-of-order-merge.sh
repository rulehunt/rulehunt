# test-guide-work-log-out-of-order-merge.sh - Regression test for issue #5516
#
# `update_work_log()` in guide.md used to filter candidate PRs purely by
# `select(.number > $last_pr)`, assuming PR numbers increase in merge order.
# They don't: a lower-numbered PR can sit in review/Doctor longer than a
# higher-numbered PR that merges first. Once a later tick recorded the
# higher-numbered PR and advanced the watermark past the lower PR's number,
# `.number > $last_pr` could never become true for it again — it was dropped
# SILENTLY and PERMANENTLY. This happened for real with PR #5507 (opened
# before, merged after, #5509).
#
# The fix (#5516) replaces the number-watermark filter for PRs with a
# presence check: a candidate is new if "PR #<N>" is NOT already literally
# recorded in WORK_LOG.md, regardless of how its number compares to anything
# already recorded. The merged-PR query window was also widened from a fixed
# `--limit 50` count to a date-bounded `--search "merged:>=<since>"` (plus a
# larger `--limit` as a safety cap), so an out-of-order PR cannot be pushed
# out of the query purely because enough other PRs merged after it.
#
# Verifies that:
#   1. guide.md defines `work_log_has_pr()` (the presence-check helper) and
#      wires it into `update_work_log()` instead of a `.number > $last_pr`
#      comparison for PR candidates; and that the merged-PR query no longer
#      relies solely on a fixed `--limit 50` (a `merged:>=` date search is
#      present, with a widened `--limit`).
#   2. THE REGRESSION, executed rather than grepped: PR A (lower number,
#      opens first) merges AFTER PR B (higher number). Once B is recorded (so
#      the old watermark sits above A's number), the fixed presence-check
#      logic still records A on the next simulated tick — reproducing
#      #5507/#5509.
#   3. The out-of-order PR is still caught even when it would have fallen
#      outside a naive fixed-count window (the scenario the date-based search
#      widening addresses) — modeled by directly exercising the presence
#      check that no longer depends on `--limit`/count at all.
#   4. Multiple out-of-order PRs landing in the same tick are all recorded.
#   5. A PR that is both out-of-order AND excluded by GUIDE_DOCS_PR_EXCLUDE
#      (issue #5454) stays excluded — the presence-check fix does not pull
#      docs-maintenance PRs back in.
#
# Hermetic: pure jq/grep against a temp dir. No forge, network, or `gh` calls.
