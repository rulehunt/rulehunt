# test-warn-operator-gated.sh - Unit tests for warn-operator-gated.sh (#5137)
#
# The `all` sentinel's aggressive candidate taxonomy hard-skips only
# loom:operator-only; every other open issue is a build candidate, even one
# whose body declares operator-gating in prose without carrying the label.
# This scans each candidate's already-fetched body for (1) instruction-shaped
# operator-gate phrases and (2) a declared Depends on / Requires #A dependency
# that itself carries loom:operator-only — annotating (never skipping,
# never mutating labels) at the confirmation gate.
#
# Strategy (mirrors test-warn-out-of-set-deps.sh): warn-operator-gated.sh
# gates its main block on `BASH_SOURCE == $0`, so we `source` it directly
# (main does not run) to get the functions in scope, then stub `gh issue
# view` on PATH to serve canned body/labels and assert on stdout.
#
# Usage:
#   ./.loom/scripts/tests/test-warn-operator-gated.sh

# SC2034: CANDIDATES / REPO_NWO / MATCH_COUNT are read only by the functions
# sourced from warn-operator-gated.sh, invisible to the linter.
# shellcheck disable=SC2034
