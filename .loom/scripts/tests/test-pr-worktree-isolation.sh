# test-pr-worktree-isolation.sh - Regression test for issue #3358
#
# Verifies that:
#   1. pr-worktree.sh creates a worktree at .loom/worktrees/pr-<N>/ with the
#      .loom-managed sentinel (PR-mode entry).
#   2. The orchestrator's main worktree HEAD is unchanged after a simulated
#      doctor pass that targets an external-fork-style PR branch (`fix/foo-bar`).
#   3. merge-pr.sh's regex tightening correctly classifies branch shapes:
#      - `feature/issue-42` -> issue-style (clean up issue-42 worktree)
#      - `release-1`        -> PR-style (clean up pr-<N> worktree)
#      - `fix/foo-bar`      -> PR-style
#      - `feature/issue-42-fix` (extra suffix) -> PR-style (strict regex)
#   4. doctor.md (defaults/) documents the branch-isolation requirement.
#
# This is a static / simulation test — we do not exercise the real `gh pr
# checkout` round-trip because that would require a live forge. The
# correctness of the regex and worktree-path selection is what we care about.
