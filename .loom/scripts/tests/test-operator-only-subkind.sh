# test-operator-only-subkind.sh - Regression test for issues #5819 and #5826
#
# `defaults/docs/label-state-machine.md` (#5671) requires that every
# application of `loom:operator-only` carry exactly one sub-kind label
# (`loom:operator-blocked` / `loom:operator-mechanical` /
# `loom:operator-decision` / `loom:operator-objective`) applied in the SAME
# command — never the base label alone. When only Champion's escalation paths
# honored that rule, a fleet-wide census found 2 of 78 operator-only issues
# across the five busiest repos carrying a sub-kind: the roles were behaving
# correctly per their own prompts, and the unauditable pile grew as
# policy-generated steady state.
#
# #5819 wired the requirement into Curator, Builder, Doctor, and Judge.
# #5826 added the fourth sub-kind (`loom:operator-objective`) and reversed
# the old "loom:operator-decision is the safe default when unsure" rule — a
# second fleet-wide measurement found manual clearing at scale only moved the
# operator-only share from 66% to 64.1%, because that "safe default" refilled
# the pile on every sweep. This suite is the mechanism that keeps both wired,
# checking two things:
#
#   1. LINT — no source under defaults/ instructs an agent (or runs code) that
#      applies `loom:operator-only` via `--add-label` without a sub-kind in the
#      same argument. A shell variable (e.g. `$SUB_KIND`) counts as satisfied;
#      Champion's escalation picks its sub-kind at runtime.
#   2. WIRING — each of the five role prompts that can apply the label carries
#      an "Applying `loom:operator-only`" section that names all four
#      sub-kinds, does NOT claim `loom:operator-decision` is a safe
#      unsure-default, states the axis-naming requirement, and repeats the
#      machine-readable `Blocked by #N` requirement that
#      `detect-dependency-cycle.sh` / `warn-operator-gated.sh` parse.
#
# The lint itself is exercised against pass/fail fixtures so it can never pass
# vacuously.
#
# Hermetic: pure file reads plus a mktemp -d fixture dir. No forge/network.
