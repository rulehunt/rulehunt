# test-land-resync-commit.sh - Smoke tests for land-resync-commit.sh (#6646)
#
# Constructs throwaway git repos (a bare "origin" + a primary checkout clone,
# plus a "third-party" clone standing in for another merged PR) to exercise
# the load-bearing cases. `gh` is a file-driven stub for the whole run (see
# below), so no test ever reaches a real forge.
#   (a) clean tree, nothing ahead           -> no-op, exit 0
#   (b) resync-only dirt, no divergence,    -> committed + pushed directly,
#       forge reports NO branch rules          exit 0 (the pre-check negative)
#   (c) resync dirt + a NON-Loom-authored   -> commits the resync, refuses to
#       commit already ahead of origin         push or rebase, exit 3; the
#                                               operator's commit SHA is
#                                               untouched (never recreated)
#   (d) resync dirt, direct push rejected   -> falls back to the STABLE
#       (origin advanced, no foreign            `chore/resync-installed`
#       commits locally)                        branch + PR (labeled
#                                               loom:review-requested), never
#                                               a forced/bypass push;
#                                               origin/<default> itself is
#                                               left untouched; the primary
#                                               checkout resets back to

#   (d2) the fallback again, later          -> the same side branch is
#       (tree re-dirtied after the reset)      force-with-lease-updated and
#                                               the existing PR is ADOPTED --

#                                               `gh pr create`
#   (e) resync dirt + unrelated dirt        -> refuses to commit ANYTHING
#   (f) --dry-run                           -> preview only, no mutation
#   (g) invoked from a linked worktree      -> refuses (mirrors #4563)
#   (h) --allow-worktree                    -> permitted, warns
#   (i) untracked, unignored path matching a pure-copy-surface pattern but
#       with no defaults/ counterpart (the Loom source repo itself only)
#                                          -> excluded from the commit
#       (#6613/#7336 parity), left dirty in the tree; a legitimate resync
#       path alongside it still lands normally
#   (j) forge reports a `pull_request` rule -> direct push SKIPPED even though
#       on the default branch, no divergence   the bare origin would have
#                                               accepted it (a bypass-capable
#                                               identity would have been let
#                                               through); branch + PR instead
#   (k) forge reports no rules but the push -> exit 4, loud BYPASS error; the
#       is accepted with a `Bypassed rule        commit is on origin (never
#       violations` warning on stderr            undone: no force push)
#   (l) re-run idempotency: fetch fails     -> exit 1, commit stays local;
#       after the commit; remote restored;     re-run on the now-CLEAN tree
#       run again                               lands it (never "nothing to
#                                               land" with a stranded commit)
#   (l2) clean tree, only an operator commit-> exit 0, nothing pushed, the
#       ahead of origin                          operator's commit untouched
#   (m) the rules API call FAILS (non-zero  -> treated as PROTECTED (fail
#       exit), bare origin would accept the     closed): direct push SKIPPED,
#       plain push                              branch + PR instead; origin/
#                                               <default> untouched

#                                                 legitimate change still lands

#                                                 legitimate resync change lands
#   (p) NO .gitignore at all + untracked    -> every one excluded, never
#       dirt in EVERY non-gh-config member     committed, never blocking; the
#       of the credential class (#8005):       legitimate change still lands
#       .loom/tokens/, .loom/accounts.env,
#       .loom/api-keys/, .loom/claude-config/
#   (p2) a TRACKED .loom/tokens/ path       -> hard stop, exit 1 (the #8004
#                                              rule now applies class-wide)
#   (p3) NO .gitignore + untracked          -> never staged either: outside the

# The script calls gh for exactly three things, all routed through here:
#   gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/rules/branches/<default> --jq '.[].type'
#       -> answers with the contents of $GH_RULES_FILE (one rule type per
#          line, as gh's --jq would print; empty/missing file = no rules);
#          if $GH_RULES_FAIL_FILE exists the call FAILS instead (exit 1 with
#          an HTTP-style error on stderr, nothing on stdout) -- the
#          transient-REST-failure case of test (m)
#   gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/branches/<default>/protection ...
#       -> always "Branch not protected" (exit 1), the legacy-API negative
#   gh pr list --head <branch> ...  (create-pr.sh's adopt-first lookup)
#       -> answers with $GH_EXISTING_PR_FILE's contents, or `null`
#   gh pr create ...                (create-pr.sh)
#       -> a fixed URL
# Every call is appended to $GH_CALLS_LOG so tests can assert what was (not)
# invoked. Putting the stub on PATH for the WHOLE run (plus LOOM_FORGE_TYPE)
# keeps every test hermetic -- a real gh reaching the network from a test
# repo whose origin is a local path is never wanted, and CI has no forge.
