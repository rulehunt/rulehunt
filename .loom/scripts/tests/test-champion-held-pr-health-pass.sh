# test-champion-held-pr-health-pass.sh - Regression tests for the merge-risk
# hold "one-way door" defect (#6720), extended for the "rebase treadmill"
# fix (#6852).
#
# Champion's 6 safety criteria (`champion-pr-merge.md`) are prose an LLM
# instance reads and executes, not a standalone script (same situation as
# test-champion-critical-file-check.sh and test-dependency-parse.sh) — so this
# file mirrors the documented control flow in local functions and pins the
# shipped markdown's exact commands with `assert_doc_contains` /
# `assert_doc_lacks`, catching drift between the two.
#
# Incident recap (#6720): criterion #2's sticky-hold precheck bailed out with
# "HOLD, silently. Skip the PR for this pass" BEFORE criteria #4 (merge
# conflict), #5 (recency) and #6 (CI status) were ever evaluated. Because
# criterion #5's stale route is the ONLY automated path from `loom:pr` to
# `loom:changes-requested` — i.e. the only way a `loom:pr` PR reaches Doctor —
# a held PR could never be reported as conflicting nor routed for a rebase.
# Measured on rjwalters/loom 2026-08-22: 21 open PRs carried `loom:pr` +
# `loom:operator`, 20 of the 21 were CONFLICTING (two untouched for 63h), and
# Doctor's `loom:changes-requested` queue was empty.
#
# The #6720 fix decouples MERGE PERMISSION from HEALTH REPORTING:
#   1. A hold (sticky OR fresh) sets MERGE_BLOCKED_BY_HOLD=true and blocks the
#      merge + criterion #3 + Steps 2-3 — but the PR is NOT dropped from the
#      pass. Criteria #4/#6/#5 still run ("Held-PR Health Pass").
#   2. A held PR that turns CONFLICTING gets one idempotent
#      `champion:held-pr-conflict-notice` comment.
#   3. A held PR that goes stale is routed to Doctor exactly like an unheld one
#      (`loom:pr` -> `loom:changes-requested`), with the
#      `champion:merge-risk-hold` marker PRESERVED so the hold re-binds and the
#      mandatory reversal comment stays mandatory (#4742). A rebase must not
#      launder a held PR into an unheld one.
#   4. `loom:operator` is KEPT on the held-and-stale route (narrowing #5802,
#      which clears it on the unheld route) — the human merge decision is still
#      outstanding, and Doctor's `loom:changes-requested` queue filters
#      `loom:blocked` / `loom:operator-only`, not `loom:operator`.
#
# Follow-up incident (#6848/#6852): the #6720 fix routes ANY held-and-stale PR
# to Doctor, including one whose ONLY blocker is the standing hold itself (no
# unresolved feedback, no failing CI). `main` moving repeatedly then produces
# an unproductive "rebase treadmill" — conflict, route to Doctor, rebase,
# still-held, `main` moves again — that cannot converge, since the real
# blocker (a pending human merge decision) is untouched by any of it. #6852
# narrows criterion #5's held route: it distinguishes a **hold-only** stale PR
# (no other red criterion — left in place, one-time suspension notice, no
# label change) from a **hold-plus-feedback** one (a failing required check —
# routes to Doctor exactly as #6720 shipped). CI status is the only currently
# available live signal cheap enough to compute every pass without inventing
# new history-tracking machinery, so it is what `HELD_CI_FAILING` is keyed on;
# criterion #6 is reordered to run BEFORE #5 so that signal is known before
# #5's routing decision. Neither branch ever touches the hold marker or
# `loom:operator` — #6720's core property (a held PR is never silently dropped
# from reporting) holds on both.
#
# This file asserts:
#   1. THE HEADLINE REGRESSION SHAPE (#6720), now the HOLD-PLUS-FEEDBACK
#      variant: hold a PR that ALSO has a failing check, let `main` move until
#      it conflicts, advance past 24h -> it still reaches Doctor
#      (`loom:changes-requested`) instead of sitting silently.
#   1B. THE HOLD-ONLY VARIANT (#6852): the identical shape MINUS the failing
#       check -> the automatic route is SUSPENDED, not fired; the PR stays on
#       `loom:pr`, still reported, still carrying `loom:operator`.
#   2. Criteria #4/#6/#5 are evaluated under a hold; #3 and the merge are not.
#   3. The conflict notice, the stale notice, and the suspension notice are
#      each posted exactly once across repeated ticks (10-minute cron
#      anti-spam).
#   4. The hold marker survives the route to Doctor on every held path, AND is
#      untouched (trivially) on the suspended path.
#   5. `loom:operator` is kept on the held route (routed or suspended) and
#      still cleared on the unheld route (#5802 not regressed).
#   6. A FRESH hold (red axis this tick) gets the same health pass as a sticky
#      one, for both the hold-plus-feedback and hold-only variants — neither
#      defect is sticky-specific.
#   7. The never-held green path is byte-for-byte unchanged (still merges).
#   8. The held-PR census jq pipeline computes count / conflicting / at-Doctor,
#      and a hold-only-suspended PR (still `loom:pr` + `loom:operator`) is
#      still counted exactly like one that routed.
#   9. The stale-notice marker is keyed per-episode (head SHA), not
#      posted-ever: a PR that cycled back to `loom:pr` with new commits and
#      then went stale AGAIN gets a fresh notice, while a re-check within the
#      SAME still-stale episode stays suppressed (#6860).
#   10. The shipped markdown carries the new literals and no longer carries
#       the short-circuiting ones.
#
# #6851 extension: the aggregate census line (above) is transcript-only — it
# is never durably recorded anywhere across passes. This file's Test 10+
# additionally covers the **per-PR digest**: hold-reason extraction from a
# PR's own `champion:merge-risk-hold` comment, per-row table formatting, and
# a drift guard pinning the pinned-tracking-issue mechanism (title/marker,
# `loom:blocked` exclusion, edit-in-place vs. create) in the shipped markdown.
#
# Recurrence incident (#7048): #6720's own fix is what made this possible —
# 2026-08-28 ~16:31Z the operator batch-removed `loom:operator` from 22
# CONFLICTING held PRs so Doctor could rebase them (the release terms were
# journaled in the operator's own incident tracking, outside this repo).
# Doctor's rebases worked, but a bare
# `--remove-label loom:operator` is not one of the four durable release
# signals "Sticky holds" (#4742) recognizes, so the hold MARKER survived and
# re-derived on the next read. When the axes were still red for the SAME
# reason (a structurally-red blast-radius axis does not change just because
# `main` moved), "Hold behavior" silently reasserted `loom:operator` —
# overriding the operator's own recent, explicit decision within hours.
# Because `loom:operator` is exactly what excludes a PR from Doctor's
# Priority-1 CONFLICTING queue (#5978), the relabeled PRs could never be
# rebased again: 17 of the 22 released PRs were re-held within ~29 hours, and
# the merge pace (recovered to ~15/day) dropped back to zero. #7048 narrows
# "Hold behavior": a manual release is still not a release SIGNAL (the axes
# are still re-judged fresh, unweakened) — but when the freshly-derived
# concern is byte-identical to the one already on record AND `loom:operator`
# was hand-removed since that record was written, the label is not silently
# reasserted. A genuinely new/different concern still re-holds normally.
# This file's Test 14/14B/15/15B cover the per-PR decision; Test 16
# simulates the actual merge-wave shape (N held PRs, each rebase re-
# conflicting the remainder) and asserts convergence to zero open conflicts
# rather than the observed stable all-held deadlock.

#   - conflict_since_for: carry the first-seen-CONFLICTING timestamp forward
#     from the PREVIOUS pass's digest body (a `champion:conflict-since:PR=<n>
#     TS=<iso>` marker) if this PR was already CONFLICTING there; otherwise
#     this is a fresh conflict episode and the clock starts at "now". A PR
#     that went MERGEABLE for even one intervening pass has no marker in
#     that pass's body, so the very next CONFLICTING pass naturally resets
#     rather than resuming the original "since" — the load-bearing edge case
#     from the issue's own Test Plan (no rot-time accumulation across a
#     MERGEABLE gap).
#   - conflict_days: whole days elapsed between a since-timestamp and "now"
#     (both ISO-8601 UTC), cross-platform (GNU `date -d`, BSD `date -j -f`).
#   - digest_status: formats the Status cell exactly as champion-pr-merge.md's
#     STATUS variable does — "<mergeable>[ since <ts>, <n>d][, out at Doctor]".
#   - digest_aggregate_line: formats the digest issue's "**Aggregate**: ..."

# Digest-issue lookup (#7338), mirrored from champion-pr-merge.md's Step 0
# `DIGEST_ISSUE=...` jq pipeline: given the `gh issue list --json
# number,body` payload for every open issue whose title matches, prefer a
# marker-tagged match (lowest number among ties, though there should only
# ever be one); when NO match carries the marker, fall back to the oldest
# (lowest-numbered) open title match instead of returning empty and letting
# Step 4b create a duplicate digest issue.
# =====================================================================
# =====================================================================
# Digest pin (#8083). The shipped line is EXTRACTED from
# champion-pr-merge.md's Step 2 and EXECUTED here — it is deliberately not
# copied into this file. Two properties are load-bearing and neither is
# obvious from the one-liner:
#   - it runs on EVERY pass, so a digest that is unpinned (never pinned in
#     the first place, or unpinned by hand) self-heals on the next tick
#     rather than staying invisible until someone notices;
#   - it is best-effort. `gh issue pin` exits non-zero when the issue is
#     already pinned, when the repo is at GitHub's 3-pin-per-repo cap, and
#     when the token lacks push scope. The digest is reporting/visibility
#     only, so none of those may abort the merge pass.
#
# #8093: the previous shape MIRRORED the line into this file and ran the
# copy, then echoed unconditionally. That made Test 12C non-discriminating
# in two independent, reproducible ways: deleting the pin line from
# champion-pr-merge.md outright left the suite green (nothing here ever
# read the shipped file), and deleting `|| true` from the mirror left it
# green too (a failing stub could not stop the following `echo
# "pass-continued"`, so sub-assertions (b)/(c)/(d) were vacuous). Both
# holes are closed below: the real line is extracted from the prompt and
# executed, and the echo standing in for "the pass continued" is gated on
# that line's own exit status with `&&`, so a non-zero pin that the line
# does NOT tolerate itself skips everything after it.
#
# This is the extract-and-execute shape #7979 asks for — the same one the
# ~20 `test-guide-*.sh` suites already use — NOT a prose-existence
# assertion over a role prompt. The only thing read out of the markdown is
# a line that is then *run*; its wording is not asserted anywhere, and the
# failures it produces are behavioural ("the pass did not continue"), not
# "two strings no longer match".
# =====================================================================
DIGEST_PIN_LINE="$(grep -m1 -F 'gh issue pin "$DIGEST_ISSUE"' "$CHAMPION_MD" || true)"

# `gh_pin` stands in for the real `gh issue pin`; its exit status is the
# only thing the extracted line observes. The trailing echo represents the
# pass carrying on to the steps that follow the pin — it is `&&`-gated on
# the extracted line's own exit status, so it is reached only when that
# line tolerates the failure itself. (Deliberately no `set -e` anywhere:
