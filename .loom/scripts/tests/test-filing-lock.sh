# test-filing-lock.sh — Tests for the machine-wide issue-filing lock (#6714)
#
# Covers defaults/scripts/lib/filing-lock.sh, the Bash half of the cross-process
# lock that replaced #3707's documentation-only "do not run concurrent
# Architects" mitigation after it regressed on 2026-08-08 and silently corrupted
# five issue bodies across two repos for 13 days:
#
#   1. acquire/release round-trip — the holder dir + owner.json appear/disappear.
#   2. THE #6714 REGRESSION — two concurrent issue-creating agents in DIFFERENT
#      repos, asserting each filed body matches the request that produced it.
#   3. BOUNDED + FAIL-SAFE — a contended acquire returns 75 (DEFER) rather than
#      filing unserialized. This is the inverse of build-slot.sh's degrade-open.
#   4. crashed holder — a dead owner PID on this host is reaped immediately.
#   5. crashed holder — an aged holder with no owner record is reaped by mtime.
#   6. a foreign host's PID is never used for liveness.
#   7. degrade OPEN when the lock store is unusable (a FILE in the way).
#   8. LOOM_FILING_LOCK=0 disables serialization entirely.
#   9. re-entrancy — LOOM_FILING_LOCK_HELD makes a nested acquire a no-op.
#  10. fleet tier — a live peer hold blocks filing and expires on its TTL.
#  11. create-issue.sh actually takes the lock (the wiring, not just the lib).
#
# Style follows test-build-slot.sh: throwaway mktemp dirs, assert harness, no
# network, no real ~/.loom.
