# test-loom-daemon-launchd-plist.sh — Tests for the launchd LaunchAgent plist
# rendering added by loom-daemon-start.sh / loom-daemon-stop.sh (#3972).
#
# Root cause under test: a plain `nohup "$DAEMON_BIN" &` leaves the daemon
# wired into the LAUNCHING SESSION's Mach bootstrap namespace, so when that
# session dies, gh/git start failing XPC lookups (trustd/opendirectoryd) for
# the daemon and every child it spawns. The fix loads the daemon as a
# `gui/<uid>` LaunchAgent instead.
#
# These tests exercise ONLY the plist-rendering path (`--print-plist`), which
# is pure string generation with NO side effects — it never calls `launchctl`
# and never touches ~/Library/LaunchAgents. This is deliberate: a test suite
# must never mutate the real machine's launchd state, on this dev box or any
# CI runner. Real `launchctl bootstrap`/`kickstart`/`bootout` behavior is not
# covered here (requires an actual GUI login session) and is validated
# manually per the daemon-reference.md Operability writeup.
#
# #6387 hardened both halves of that claim, after it turned out NOT to hold:
#   * the cases that drive the provisioning-capable code paths (tests 15-19)
#     do so through a STUB launchctl/systemctl on PATH, inside a fully
#     self-contained fixture repo — never the real tool, never the real
#     checkout;
#   * every case `cd`s into a fixture before invoking the script, so
#     find_repo_root($PWD) can never resolve the real checkout's real pid file
#     (the 2026-08-16 root cause);
#   * and a post-suite assertion (test 20) checks `launchctl list` /
#     `systemctl --user list-units` directly, because a job bootstrapped into
#     the real domain is invisible to a plist-file count taken in a scratch
#     $HOME and survives the fixture's own `rm -rf`.
#
# Style matches test-loom-daemon-start.sh — plain bash, hand-rolled
# assertions. Bats is NOT used in this repository.

# Usage:

# WHICH BINARY IMPLEMENTS THE STUB (#8134, epic #7810 / #8087)
#
# loom-daemon-start.sh is a thin stub over `loom-daemon daemon-start`, so every
# `--print-plist` below renders from the Rust unless the stub execs the binary
# built from this working tree. `--self-only` is mandatory: every case here
# pins $LOOM_DAEMON_BIN to a FAKE daemon binary so the rendered
# ProgramArguments is deterministic, and $LOOM_DAEMON_BIN means "the daemon
# this caller manages or probes" — not "the binary that implements me".
# Without the split the stub would exec the fake as itself and print its
# output instead of a plist.
#
# This is a HARNESS change, not an assertion change: every expectation below is
# byte-for-byte what it was against the shell (verification-recipes.md §6).

# LOOM_AUTONOMY_MARKER) -- every one of them points at the OPERATOR'S REAL
# daemon state. Inherited, they make this suite resolve real state in exactly
# the way this file's header forbids: the real pid file (the 2026-08-16
# incident), the real autonomy marker, and the real installed plist, whose env

# Same fixture, plus the two seams the PROVISIONING cases (18/19) need in order
# to reach a real provisioning branch on a Linux host. Deliberately NOT folded
# into live_run above: cases 15-17 assert that NOTHING provisions, and a seam
# whose only purpose is to arm a provisioning branch has no business being set
# while proving that.
#
#   LOOM_SYSTEMD_FORCE=1 — systemd-user.sh's own documented test seam. Without
#     it, is_linux_systemd() requires a REACHABLE `systemd --user` manager
#     (XDG_RUNTIME_DIR + a non-"offline" `is-system-running`), which a hermetic
#     CI container does not have — so heal_watchdog_provisioning_gap would take
#     its "no mechanism on this tier" escalation branch and make ZERO
#     supervisor calls, and cases 18/19 would assert against nothing. With the
#     seam, is_linux_systemd() reduces to `command -v systemctl`, which
#     resolves to the stub in $LIVE_STUB_BIN. On Darwin the seam is inert for
#     these cases: heal_use_launchd is decided (and wins) before heal_is_systemd
#     is even consulted, so the launchd branch is still what gets exercised.
#   LOOM_SYSTEMD_UNIT — names the systemd side after the SAME test label the
#     launchd side uses, so test 20's live-job scan covers both mechanisms with
#     one substring.

# ---------- #6568: agent-session isolation (render side) ----------
# Root cause under test: a daemon-dispatched sweep invoked loom-daemon-start.sh
# on 2026-08-17 to exercise the start path. Two independent properties combined
# to overwrite the PRODUCTION LaunchAgent on BOTH operator Macs, silently, for
# two days:
#
#   1. render_launchd_plist / render_systemd_unit harvest EVERY exported LOOM_*
#      var into the durable env dict -- so LOOM_SWEEP_CLAIM_OWNED=6388,
#      LOOM_TERMINAL_ID=..., LOOM_ROLE=sweep-lifecycle, LOOM_RUNTIME=claude all
#      became production daemon config.
#   2. resolve_launchd_label() returns the fixed production label whenever
#      LOOM_LAUNCHD_LABEL is unset, so the write landed on the real job.
#
# Cases 21-24 cover the render/preview side (this suite's remit); the
# REAL-START refusal is covered in test-loom-daemon-start.sh's "SI." section,
# because it must drive the actual install path, not a preview.
