# test-loom-daemon-update.sh — Tests for loom-daemon-update.sh (Issue #3968).
#
# Focus: (1) staleness detection (--check, built-commit vs. source-HEAD
# comparison), (2) flag preservation across a rebuild+restart (the persisted
# .loom/.daemon.flags file must be replayed verbatim, never widened), and
# (3) the "was not running -> do not start" / --no-restart / --dry-run
# guardrails that keep the FLAGS-OFF/opt-in contract intact.
#
# Style matches test-loom-daemon-start.sh — plain bash, hand-rolled
# assertions, no bats.
#
# Strategy: build a throwaway repo root (temp dir) with a real `.git`, a
# stub `loom-daemon/Cargo.toml`, real copies of loom-daemon-start.sh /
# loom-daemon-stop.sh (so the restart path exercises the actual scripts, not
# a mock), a FAKE `cargo` on PATH that "builds" by copying a prepared fake
# daemon binary into target/release/ instead of actually compiling Rust, and
# FAKE daemon binaries whose `--version` output embeds a controllable commit
# and whose normal-run mode records the autonomy env vars it inherited to a
# marker file before looping (staying "alive" for PID-liveness checks).
#
# Usage:

# Production-binary checksum guard (#4381 incident): 2026-07-29 ~06:03Z, the
# REAL machine-level `~/.local/bin/loom-daemon` was overwritten with a fake,
# infinitely-looping test-fixture stub for ~9 hours (an operator `status` poll
# hung; a crash at any point would have had launchd relaunch the stub). Root
# cause: three tests below (37/39/43, the ff-sync/staleness-detection cases)
# deliberately invoke loom-daemon-update.sh with NEITHER LOOM_DAEMON_BIN NOR a
# stubbed scripts/install/provision-daemon.sh, so the update script's
# provision_machine_daemon() call fell through to its real, un-sandboxed
# default destination (`${LOOM_DAEMON_BIN_DIR:-$HOME/.local/bin}`) — the
# operator's own real $HOME. The LOOM_DAEMON_BIN_DIR export below (threaded to
# every sub-invocation) is the actual fix; THIS checksum snapshot is the
# regression backstop that fails the suite outright if any current or future
# test call site regresses into writing the real production binary, even if
# the sandboxing above is bypassed or a new call site is added without it.
# Recorded before ANYTHING else runs, using the checksum tool most likely
# present (sha256sum on Linux, shasum on macOS); skipped (empty) only when
# neither is on PATH or no binary exists yet at that path (nothing to compare
# against — a fresh-machine first run).

# Force the legacy nohup path on LINUX too (#4799 CI hang). The launchd knob
# above only sandboxes Darwin; on a Linux runner `MINIMAL_PATH` below still
# reaches the REAL /usr/bin/systemctl and `is_linux_systemd` (lib/systemd-user.sh)
# returns true whenever the runner has a reachable `systemctl --user` manager.
# That made the suite non-hermetic AND non-terminating in CI:
#
#   1. scenario 5's real loom-daemon-start.sh took the systemd branch and ran
#      `systemctl --user enable --now loom-daemon.service` -- the DEFAULT unit
#      name, i.e. the operator's/runner's real user unit, plus a real
#      `loom-daemon-watchdog.timer` (provision_watchdog_job_systemd derives its
#      name from the daemon unit, NOT from the sandboxed LOOM_WATCHDOG_LABEL).
#   2. every LATER scenario then saw `systemd_unit_loaded` == true, so
#      loom-daemon-update.sh resolved DAEMON_MANAGER=systemd and took the
#      supervised-restart branch: `"$PROVISION_TARGET" restart`.
#   3. PROVISION_TARGET is the fake-daemon fixture, which has no `restart`
#      handler -- so it fell straight into its `while true; do sleep 1; done`
#      daemon body IN THE FOREGROUND and never returned. Scenario 5b wedged
#      there for the full 1200s per-suite CI budget (exit 124).
#
# A macOS dev run never exercises any of this (no systemctl), which is exactly
# why the suite passed locally in ~4m and hung in CI. The systemd-specific
# scenarios (26-34) opt back in explicitly with LOOM_DAEMON_SYSTEMD=1 alongside
# their LOOM_SYSTEMD_FORCE=1 seam and their own stub `systemctl` on PATH.

# ---------- live daemon state sandbox (#5179) ----------
# ONE helper owns EVERY live-state path this suite could otherwise reach, so a
# state file added to the daemon later is isolated by construction rather than
# after it leaks in production. It supersedes the per-variable overrides that
# used to live here, and covers (see lib/live-state-sandbox.sh for the full
# rationale per variable):
#
#   LOOM_PID_FILE          the #5179 leak itself. The ambient value a Loom
#                          agent session exports names the REAL .daemon.pid,
#                          and it is tier 1 of daemon_pidfile.rs's resolver —
#                          ahead of every other tier — so an un-overridden
#                          suite does not get a neutral default, it inherits
#                          the live path and rewrites it under a running
#                          daemon (observed: a false `degraded` liveness
#                          verdict on a healthy host, plus a poisoned input
#                          for the #5118/#5126 watchdog).
#   LOOM_AUTONOMY_MARKER   #4011/#5131: a restart path that reaches the real
#                          loom-daemon-start.sh must never write the
#                          operator's ~/.loom/autonomy-desired.
#   LOOM_SOCKET_PATH       its parent is the daemon's `loom_dir`, so the
#                          heartbeat + machine-level logs follow it into the
#                          sandbox (start.sh documents this seam explicitly).
#   LOOM_DAEMON_BIN_DIR    #4381 incident (see the checksum-guard writeup at
#                          the top of this file): update.sh resolves its
#                          machine-level install destination as
#                          `${LOOM_DAEMON_BIN_DIR:-$HOME/.local/bin}` whenever
#                          LOOM_DAEMON_BIN is unset, and tests 37/39/43
#                          deliberately exercise that no-LOOM_DAEMON_BIN path.
#   LOOM_DAEMON_BIN        #4902: unset, because the ambient agent-session
#                          value names the real production binary and would
#                          win over LOOM_DAEMON_BIN_DIR.
#   LOOM_WORKSPACE /       unset, so each sub-invocation resolves its own
#   LOOM_MACHINE_CHECKOUT  fixture instead of the live checkout / machine-mode
#                          state home. Tests that need either pin it inline.
#
# Tests below that need a pinned value still set it on their own invocation
# (e.g. `LOOM_DAEMON_BIN="$W1/..." bash ...`), which applies regardless.
#
# The return code is CHECKED, never bare (#6420). init returns non-zero when it
# could not `cd` into the sandbox root (#6386 — the cwd tier is then still aimed
# at wherever this suite was launched from, i.e. potentially a LIVE checkout) or
# when the ambient supervisor label is the real production one (#5501). This
# suite runs under `set -uo pipefail` with NO `-e`, so a bare call would swallow
# both and continue with a HALF-ARMED sandbox — the exact state the helper's own
# failure path exists to prevent — while driving the real lifecycle scripts.
#
# FIXTURE CONTAINMENT (#8712) is armed on the same line and for the same reason:
# it declares $BASE_WORKDIR as the only place this suite's fixtures may write,
# which closes the one damaging path the live-state sandbox does not cover — the
# REAL checkout's `loom-daemon/target/release/loom-daemon`, where
# `loom_resolve_self_daemon_bin` looks for the binary implementing
# `release-fetch`. A fixture fake left there made every `--fetch` on
# loom-worker-1 fail for hours. Same failure handling: a containment guard that
# could not be armed is a half-armed sandbox, and this suite refuses to run.

#
# Builds an ISOLATED fixture copy of loom-daemon-update.sh (+ EVERY lib it
# sources -- three as of #8770's bounded-run.sh; each is a hard dependency
# that exits 1 when absent, so a lib missing from the cp below shows up here
# as a 20/20 race failure, not as a missing-file error) so this scenario can
# safely race a background writer against it without ever touching the real
# UPDATE_SCRIPT -- corrupting the repo's own checked-in script, even
# transiently, would be far worse than the flake this regression test exists
# to catch.
#
# The race: launch a background `cat orig > fixture` (a same-path
# truncate+rewrite, byte-identical content) in its own backgrounded
# subshell -- empirically, that extra fork generation lines the writer's
# truncate up against THIS bash invocation's own script load closely enough
# to reproduce the #7201 failure shape ~95-100% of the time per attempt,
# vs. effectively 0% with a bare `cmd &` (no subshell) whose write finishes
# well before a freshly-forked bash even opens the script. Both the
# single-early-read banner capture (`_LOOM_HELP_BANNER`, #7794 -- which
# replaced #7201's lazy double-read + five-retry show_help()) and the
# whole-invocation retry (scenario 8 above) get exercised here, together,
# across many iterations -- proving the combination holds up, not just a
# single lucky run.
#
# THIS SCENARIO IS THE GATE ON THAT REPLACEMENT. #7794 measured it directly:
# unretried, the deliberate race fails 80/400 against the old lazy read and
# 45/400 against the single early read; with the retry budget below it is
# 0/200 racing iterations for the new form. Do not delete it -- it is the only
# thing standing between a future "simplify the banner read" edit and #7201
# coming back.

#     was invoked BY ABSOLUTE PATH from $HOME on a fleet host where
#     `~/.loom/tokens` exists (the token pool `loom-daemon tokens bootstrap`
#     provisions), so the old `.loom`-only upward walk matched $HOME on its
#     first iteration and refused with "No loom-daemon/Cargo.toml found at
#     $HOME/loom-daemon" -- a path the operator never named. Two fixes are
#     asserted here: the walk now requires .git ALONGSIDE .loom/ (so a bare
#     ~/.loom is never mistaken for a checkout), and the script falls back to
#     the checkout it physically lives in, which is unambiguous when it is
#     invoked by absolute path.

# 56b. THE #5119 INCIDENT (2026-08-03 loom-worker-1): systemd restart ack'd, the
#      daemon exited 0, but on a busy host the unit sat in
#      `deactivating (stop-sigterm)` while systemd reaped the sweep/role children
#      still in the cgroup — long past the #4950 pid poll on a stale unit's 90s
#      TimeoutStopSec. The pre-#5119 code read ActiveState once, saw
#      `deactivating` (not yet `failed`), and "refused to guess" -> exit 7, daemon
#      left DOWN. Under #5119 the updater WAITS for the stop to settle (here it

#      reset-failed+start RECOVERS it -> exit 0, no manual intervention. This is

# 63. Same combined shape as test 62, but the co-existing dirty tracked file IS
#     Loom-managed. The content-identical classifier must STILL decline (its
#     `git reset --hard` is only vouched-for on a clean tree), handing the case
#     to the managed-dirty classifier instead. That one discards the managed
#     edit it is authorized to discard and retries the fast-forward, which
#     still cannot apply over the history divergence -- so the run hard-aborts
#     (exit 1) with local commits intact, rather than silently hard-resetting
#     from the content-identical branch. Deliberately NOT resolved end-to-end:
#     widening either classifier to cover the combination is exactly the kind
#     of "when genuinely unsure" widening the #4381 safety note forbids.

# Artifact-fetch mode (Epic #4990 Phase 3, #5020) tests A-V live in the
# sibling suite test-loom-daemon-update-fetch.sh, split out by #7810 PR 6a:
# fetch_and_verify_artifact() now delegates to `loom-daemon release-fetch`
# and so needs a BUILT binary, which this suite must not require -- it is one
# of the five host-mutating suites run-ci-suites.sh guards via
# LIVE_DAEMON_GUARDED_SUITES (#6386), and that membership is pinned as an
# explicit literal in test-run-ci-suites-daemon-guard.sh. The fixtures both
# suites need (write_fake_daemon, write_fake_codesign*, write_fake_cosign*)
# moved into lib/daemon-update-fixtures.sh so both build identical ones from
# a single definition, the same reasoning #7977 already applied to
# write_fake_gh/write_fake_artifact_daemon/write_fake_cargo.

# P1-P8. --prune-stale-entry-points (#5139): the stale-entry-point advisory
#     (tests 45-48 above) detects but never removes anything. This flag

#     a legitimate bash-wrapper shim (whether current or itself stale).

#                               (must survive) — the AC's named example
#         - loom-tokens      : a stale pip console script (must be pruned)
#         - loom-agent-spawn : a second stale pip console script (pruned)

#       POLD_SHIM_DIR (a second PATH entry, simulating a moved install):
#         - loom-recover-orphans : an auto-generated shim whose sibling
#                                   loom-daemon does NOT match the resolved
#                                   binary (a STALE shim) — reported by the

#     exits/relaunches (simulating "in-flight sweep never finished within the

#     STILL RUNNING, and — critically — the reset-failed+start self-heal is
#     NEVER invoked (that would defeat the fail-safe by forcing exactly the
