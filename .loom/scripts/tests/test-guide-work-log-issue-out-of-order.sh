# test-guide-work-log-issue-out-of-order.sh - Regression test for issue #5539
#
# `update_work_log()` in guide.md used to filter candidate closed issues
# purely by `select(.number > $last_issue)`, assuming issue numbers close in
# the same order they were opened. They don't: a lower-numbered issue can
# stay open (blocked, deferred, reopened) longer than a higher-numbered issue
# that closes first. Once a later tick recorded the higher-numbered issue and
# advanced the watermark past the lower issue's number, `.number >
# $last_issue` could never become true for it again — it was dropped
# SILENTLY and PERMANENTLY. This is the exact #5516 failure shape (already
# fixed on the PR side by PR #5531's `work_log_has_pr()`), just on the issue
# side — observed for real as 30 out-of-order-closed issues silently dropped
# from WORK_LOG.md.
#
# The fix (#5539) replaces the number-watermark filter for issues with a
# presence check: a candidate is new if "Issue #<N>" is NOT already literally
# recorded in WORK_LOG.md, regardless of how its number compares to anything
# already recorded. The closed-issue query window was also widened from a
# fixed `--limit 50` count to a date-bounded `--search "closed:>=<since>"`
# (plus a larger `--limit` as a safety cap), so an out-of-order issue cannot
# be pushed out of the query purely because enough other issues closed after
# it.
#
# Verifies that:
#   1. guide.md defines `work_log_has_issue()` (the presence-check helper)
#      and wires it into `update_work_log()` instead of a
#      `.number > $last_issue` comparison for issue candidates; and that the
#      closed-issue query no longer relies solely on a fixed `--limit 50` (a
#      `closed:>=` date search is present, with a widened `--limit`).
#   2. THE REGRESSION, executed rather than grepped: issue A (lower number,
#      opens first) closes AFTER issue B (higher number). Once B is recorded
#      (so the old watermark sits above A's number), the fixed
#      presence-check logic still records A on the next simulated tick.
#   3. The out-of-order issue is still caught even when it would have fallen
#      outside a naive fixed-count window (the scenario the date-based
#      search widening addresses) — modeled by directly exercising the
#      presence check that no longer depends on `--limit`/count at all.
#   4. Multiple out-of-order issues landing in the same tick are all
#      recorded.
#
# Hermetic: pure jq/grep against a temp dir. No forge, network, or `gh` calls.
