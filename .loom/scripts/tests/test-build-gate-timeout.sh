# test-build-gate-timeout.sh — regression test for #6192 ("Sweep build steps
# have no timeout — a wedged build volume accumulated 5 concurrent hung cargo
# builds for one sweep, plus orphans past sweep exit").
#
# Covers the three sweep-side mechanisms that issue added:
#
#   AC1/AC2 — `defaults/scripts/build-gate.sh` runs each toolchain stage under
#             a configurable wall-clock budget. With a stubbed `cargo` on PATH
#             standing in for a disk-wait-wedged build, the gate must fail
#             LOUDLY (naming the hung command + its elapsed time against the
#             budget) and exit a distinct 124 rather than hanging forever. A
#             fast, well-behaved run must be unaffected.
#   AC4     — a timed-out step arms the per-issue dispatch backoff (#4485) via
#             `loom-daemon dispatch-backoff record`, so the next retry is
#             deferred rather than immediate. Driven here with a recording
#             stub binary via $LOOM_DAEMON_BIN, so no daemon is needed.
#   AC3     — `lib/reap-process-group.sh`'s self-reap, in isolation.
#
# Hermetic: PATH-stubs `cargo`, stubs the daemon binary, disables the build
# slot + the `nice` re-exec, and never touches a forge, a socket, or a real
# toolchain.
#
# Every subject this suite exercises — build-gate.sh, lib/reap-process-group.sh,
# claude-wrapper.sh — is a *shipped* script (scripts/* -> .loom/scripts/* per
# scripts/install/manifest.sh), so this suite is meaningful in an installed
# consumer repo too, where no defaults/ directory exists at all. It therefore
# resolves each subject the way each layout actually lays it out:
# `.loom/scripts/<name>` first (installed consumer repos, and Loom's own
# dogfooded checkout, where .loom/scripts is a symlink to defaults/scripts),
# falling back to `defaults/scripts/<name>` (a bare source checkout with no
# .loom/scripts/ symlink/copy yet). See issue #6194.
#
# Usage:
