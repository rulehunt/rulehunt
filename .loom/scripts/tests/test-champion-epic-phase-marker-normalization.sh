# test-champion-epic-phase-marker-normalization.sh - Regression tests for
# #6967: champion-epic.md's Step 2.75 ("Pre-Creation Existence Check for
# Phase Issues") and "Detecting Phase Completion" both compared phase markers
# via an EXACT literal-string `--search="loom:epic:$EPIC_NUMBER:phase:$PHASE
# in:body"` query. A pre-existing marker in a different form for the same
# logical phase (e.g. a historical/foreign `phase:B` marker) does not match a
# later pass's freshly-derived numeric `phase:2` under that comparison, so
# the existence check silently misses it and creates a duplicate phase-issue
# set -- the same class of missing-idempotency bug #6601 already fixed for
# the "nothing at all existed" case, now recurring for "something existed,
# but in a different phase-token form".
#
# champion-epic.md's Step 2.75 and "Detecting Phase Completion" are prose an
# LLM instance reads and executes, not a standalone script (same situation as
# test-champion-critical-file-check.sh) -- so this file mirrors the
# documented `canonicalize_phase()` + candidate-filter logic in local
# functions and pins the shipped markdown's exact commands with
# `assert_doc_contains` / `assert_doc_lacks`, catching drift between the two.
#
# The fix (#6967):
#   1. `canonicalize_phase()` maps a phase token to a canonical integer --
#      A/B/C/... (case-insensitive) to 1/2/3/..., and a bare integer to
#      itself -- so `phase:B` and `phase:2` compare equal. An unrecognized
#      token (anything else) is returned unchanged, so it can never
#      *falsely* collapse into a match.
#   2. Both call sites widen their `--search` query to the epic-number
#      prefix only (`loom:epic:$EPIC_NUMBER:phase in:body`, dropping the
#      exact `:$PHASE` suffix) and then narrow precisely, client-side, by
#      canonicalized comparison of each candidate's own marker token --
#      strictly more inclusive at the query layer, never less precise at the
#      decision layer.
#   3. Phase-issue creation (Step 3 and "Creating Next Phase Issues") already
#      emits the marker in canonical numeric form only (`phase:1`,
#      `phase:<N+1>`) -- verified unchanged by this fix, pinned below so a
#      future edit can't silently reintroduce a letter-form emission.
#
# What this asserts:
#   1. canonicalize_phase() maps A/B/C (any case) to 1/2/3, passes bare
#      integers through unchanged, and leaves an unrecognized token as-is.
#   2. A pre-existing `phase:B`-marked issue is found as "already exists"
#      when a later pass re-derives `PHASE=2` for the same logical phase --
#      no duplicate would be created.
#   3. Two genuinely different phases (`phase:1` vs `phase:2`) are NEVER
#      treated as equivalent -- an issue for one phase never counts as
#      "already exists" for the other.
#   4. The same canonicalized-filter logic also fixes "Detecting Phase
#      Completion": a closed `phase:B` issue counts toward PHASE=2's
#      closed-count, so phase-completion is still correctly detected even
#      when the existing issue predates the numeric-only convention.
#   5. The shipped markdown defines `canonicalize_phase()` at both call
#      sites, widens both `--search` queries to the epic-number prefix, and
#      still emits only canonical numeric markers at both creation sites.
