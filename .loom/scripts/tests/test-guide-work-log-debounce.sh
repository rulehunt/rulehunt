# test-guide-work-log-debounce.sh - Regression test for issue #6133
#
# Between 2026-08-13's PRs #6088-#6091, 4 near-identical `docs: Guide document
# maintenance update` PRs merged in ~3h for ~20 total net lines -- driven by
# `update_work_log()` filing a fresh PR on the very next tick that found ANY
# new merged PR or closed issue not yet recorded (subject only to the "one
# open docs PR at a time" lock, which prevents overlapping PRs, not cadence).
# WORK_PLAN.md already had a time-based debounce for the analogous problem
# (#5890/#5929) -- this issue extends batching to WORK_LOG.md.
#
# Unlike WORK_PLAN's periodic full-regenerate, WORK_LOG is
# append-only/event-driven: entries only need to be recorded before a prior
# tick's presence-check window ages them out, not "correct as of right now".
# So the #6133 fix batches pending entries via TWO knobs evaluated together
# (mirroring `LOOM_WORK_PLAN_DEBOUNCE_SECS`'s shape, plus an entry-count
# escape hatch WORK_PLAN has no equivalent of):
#   - `LOOM_WORK_LOG_MIN_ENTRIES` (default 5): a pending delta at or above
#     this size writes IMMEDIATELY, debounce window or not -- the
#     "no starvation" guarantee for a large accumulated delta.
#   - `LOOM_WORK_LOG_DEBOUNCE_SECS` (default 1800 = 30 min): below the
#     min-entries threshold, a pending delta waits until at least this long
#     has elapsed since WORK_LOG.md was last actually WRITTEN by a merged
#     docs-maintenance PR, anchored via `last_work_log_write_epoch()` (mirrors
#     `last_work_plan_write_epoch()`, #5929's fix, but filtered to merges
#     whose changed files include WORK_LOG.md instead of WORK_PLAN.md).
#
# Verifies that:
#   1. guide.md defines `last_work_log_write_epoch()`, reusing
#      `GUIDE_DOCS_PR_EXCLUDE` rather than redefining the docs-PR predicate,
#      AND filters merged PRs down to ones whose `files` include
#      `WORK_LOG.md` (mirrors #5929's WORK_PLAN.md filter).
#   2. guide.md's `update_work_log()` gates the write behind BOTH
#      `LOOM_WORK_LOG_DEBOUNCE_SECS` (default 1800) and
#      `LOOM_WORK_LOG_MIN_ENTRIES` (default 5).
#   3. THE REGRESSION, executed rather than grepped: a reconstruction of the
#      debounce arithmetic, run against fixture timelines --
#        a. a tick within the debounce window with a small pending delta
#           does not write (batches instead).
#        b. a tick past the debounce window with the same pending delta
#           writes.
#        c. a sufficiently large accumulated delta writes immediately even
#           INSIDE the debounce window (the min-entries escape hatch --
#           the "no starvation" guarantee for large deltas).
#        d. zero pending entries never writes, regardless of window/size.
#        e. the first-ever tick (no prior WORK_LOG-writing docs PR to anchor
#           the debounce clock, last_merged_epoch == 0) still writes
#           immediately for a small delta -- never suppressed by a write
#           that never happened.
#   4. `last_work_log_write_epoch()`'s jq filter, executed against a fixture
#      that mixes a WORK_PLAN-only docs PR (must be skipped) with an older
#      docs PR that actually touched WORK_LOG.md (must be selected).
#
# Hermetic: pure grep/jq/arithmetic against fixture values. No forge,
# network, or `gh` calls.
