# test-sweep-lease-publish.sh - Unit tests for sweep-lease-publish.sh (#6320).
#
# Black-box tests, mirroring test-sweep-lease-renew.sh's harness:
# sweep-lease-publish.sh is a full CLI script, so `gh` is stubbed on PATH
# (real `jq`/`date`/`awk` are used unstubbed — their logic is what's under
# test) and the real script runs as a subprocess, asserting on
# stdout/stderr/exit code and on the exact request body the stub captured.
#
# The stub reproduces real `gh api` -f/-F semantics: only `-F` applies the
# `@-` read-from-stdin magic, `-f` sends the literal string. That
# distinction is the subject of test (h) — the same trap that silently
# destroyed live lease records via sweep-lease-renew.sh.
#
# Covers:
#   (a) publish on an issue with no lease comment posts a well-formed record
#       whose LITERAL first line is the marker, and prints "<host> <sweep-id>"
#   (b) publish is idempotent for the same host+sweep-id with a fresh lease
#       (no duplicate comment posted, still exit 0)
#   (c) a fresh lease held by a DIFFERENT host -> exit 4, nothing posted
#   (d) a STALE lease (past TTL), same host or a peer's, does not block
#       publication
#   (e) a fresh lease from a different sweep on the SAME host -> publishes
#       anyway (this sweep is the one working the issue now)
#   (f) a `gh` READ failure fails open: publishes anyway
#   (g) a `gh` WRITE failure -> exit 2 (caller proceeds without a lease)
#   (h) the POST uses `-F body=@-` (stdin), never `-f` (literal "@-")
#   (i) usage errors: bad issue number, unknown flag, bad --ttl-minutes,
#       whitespace/`-->` in --host/--sweep-id
#   (j) comments that merely MENTION the marker mid-body are not leases
#       (startswith, not substring)
#   (k) --host omitted publishes the OPAQUE form of this host's identity by
#       default (Issue #6322/#6333), not the raw hostname; LOOM_LEASE_PUBLISH_
#       HOSTNAME=1 opts back into the raw form
#   (l) publish -> fence round trip: a lease this script just published is
#       read back as "own, fresh" by sweep-lease-fence.sh's default (no
#       --host) resolution -- the exact invocation builder-pr.md makes. This
#       is the regression test for #6333: before the fix, sweep-lease-
#       publish.sh wrote the RAW host while sweep-lease-fence.sh compared
#       against the OPAQUE host, so a sweep's own fresh lease read back as a
#       PEER's and the fence self-deadlocked (exit 4) on every in-session run.
#   (m) regression (#6333 review): a fresher same-host/different-sweep lease
#       must not mask an OLDER-but-still-fresh PEER lease. Before this fix,
#       the peer check only inspected the single overall-freshest comment by
#       `updated_at` -- if that happened to be this host's own record under a
#       different sweep-id, the same-host NOTE branch published without ever
#       scanning for a genuinely different host's independently fresh lease.
#   (n) regression (Issue #5331): a fresh PEER lease that has already been
#       YIELDED (a matching `<!-- loom:lease-yield host=... sweep=...
#       earliest_host=... -->` record posted for that peer's own (host,
#       sweep) -- the daemon's dispatch-time claim-then-verify-order
#       tie-break, #6287) no longer blocks publication. Before this fix, a
#       still-"fresh" (within-TTL) but already-superseded lease kept forcing
#       every later publisher on the same issue to SKIP (exit 4) in
#       deference to a claim the tie-break machinery had already resolved
#       away -- the phantom-block mechanism that lets a multi-host race
#       churn indefinitely instead of converging. Mirrors sweep-lease-fence.
#       sh's own #6485 yield-exclusion fix, applied here on the write side.

# sweep's own just-published lease read back as a PEER's -> exit 4
# (self-fencing deadlock, every in-session sweep reaching Step 1b would
# abort before push/PR-open). This exercises the exact pairing
# defaults/.claude/commands/loom/builder-pr.md makes: publish with no
# --host, then `fence check` with no --host, both resolving the same
