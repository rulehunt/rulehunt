# test-champion-standing-authorization.sh - Regression tests for the Champion
# standing-authorization mechanism (#6850): an optional
# `.loom/config.json` -> `champion.standingAuthorizations` block letting an
# operator pre-authorize an entire merge-risk *class* (e.g. guard-hook edits)
# so criterion #2 (Merge-Risk Judgment) can skip the four-axis judgment for a
# matching PR, given every stated condition mechanically holds.
#
# champion-pr-merge.md's "Standing operator authorization (#6850)" subsection
# is prose an LLM instance reads and executes, not a standalone script (same
# situation as test-docs-only-fast-path.sh and
# test-champion-critical-file-check.sh) -- so this file mirrors the documented
# matcher/validator logic in a local copy and pins the shipped markdown's
# exact commands with `assert_doc_contains`, catching drift between the two.
#
# What this asserts:
#   1. The mirrored glob matcher correctly requires an EXACT SUBSET match
#      (every changed file matches at least one pattern in the class) --
#      one file outside the class's patterns disqualifies the whole PR from
#      that class, mirroring the docs-only fast path's exact-subset rule.
#   2. A malformed class entry (missing id/filePatterns/conditions, or an
#      unrecognized condition string) is treated as invalid -- it never
#      authorizes anything -- without disabling sibling entries in the array.
#   3. No `champion.standingAuthorizations` key, or an empty array, is a
#      structural no-op (mirrors "absent = byte-for-byte unchanged").
#   4. champion-pr-merge.md ships the config schema, the closed condition
#      vocabulary, the fail-safe-on-malformed-entry behavior, and documents
#      this mechanism as orthogonal to `loom:auto-merge-ok`.
#   5. champion-reference.md documents the new mechanism too.
#
# Usage:
#   ./.loom/scripts/tests/test-champion-standing-authorization.sh
