# test-docs-guide-lock.sh - Regression test for issue #5573
#
# The Guide role's Document Maintenance Step 1 used to be a plain
# check-then-act: query for an open docs PR, and if none, proceed through
# docs-worktree.sh (a single shared worktree slot) to `gh pr create`. Two
# Guide ticks starting within the same short window could both see "no open
# PR" before either had pushed a branch, race each other into
# docs-worktree.sh (the second clobbering the first's in-progress state), and
# both end up creating their own docs PR (observed: #5571 and #5572, opened
# 49 seconds apart with an identical diff shape).
#
# docs-guide-lock.sh closes the gap with a non-blocking mkdir-based lock held
# across the whole Step-1-through-Step-5 window. This suite verifies:
#
#   1. acquire/release round-trip, and `status` reflects held/free correctly.
#   2. serialization — a second concurrent acquire is refused (busy) while
#      the first holds the lock; only one of two truly concurrent,
#      backgrounded acquire attempts wins (the actual race scenario, not
#      just a sequential simulation of it).
#   3. release is idempotent (safe even when the lock was never acquired).
#   4. stale-lock recovery — a lock older than LOOM_DOCS_GUIDE_LOCK_STALE_SECS
#      is reaped by the next acquire attempt, so a crashed tick can never
#      permanently block future ticks.
#   5. argument validation (unknown command, bad stale-secs value).
#   6. guide.md's Document Maintenance phase actually acquires the lock in
#      Step 1 before the open-PR check, and releases it on every exit path
#      out of Step 1 and Step 5 (both the "no changes" and success paths of
#      create_docs_pr()) — and the pre-existing #5454 self-referential-PR
#      exclusion is still intact (this fix must not reintroduce that bug).
#
# Hermetic: throwaway git repo under mktemp -d, no forge/network calls.
