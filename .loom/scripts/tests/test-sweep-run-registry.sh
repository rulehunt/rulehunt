# test-sweep-run-registry.sh - Smoke tests for the sweep run-identity registry (#3768).
#
# Exercises `new` (stable run id generation + registration), `peers` (live-peer
# listing + dead-PID pruning), `cleanup`, and `list`, plus the concurrency
# properties the /sweep skill relies on:
#   - each `new` yields a distinct run id (concurrent sweeps don't collide),
#   - a run never lists itself as a peer,
#   - a dead-PID entry is pruned and never warns forever,
#   - the run id is filename/JSON-safe.
#
# Run from anywhere — uses an isolated TMPDIR so it never touches a real
# workspace's .loom/sweep-run/.
