# test-detect-unlabeled-epics.sh - Unit tests for detect-unlabeled-epics.sh (#6715)
#
# detect-unlabeled-epics.sh is a report-only backstop that scans open issues
# for an epic shape (title prefix "Epic:", a "## Phases" body heading, or a
# "[Epic #N]" reference from an open loom:epic-phase child issue's title)
# that carries no `loom:epic` label. It never mutates labels.
#
# Strategy (mirrors test-warn-operator-gated.sh): detect-unlabeled-epics.sh
# gates its main block on `BASH_SOURCE == $0` and defers sourcing
# lib/forge-helpers.sh to that same guarded block, so `source`-ing it here
# only loads the pure functions under test -- no live `gh`/forge dependency,
# no `set -e` pollution from the sourced lib.
#
# Usage:
#   ./.loom/scripts/tests/test-detect-unlabeled-epics.sh

# SC2034: DISMISS_LIST / MATCH_COUNT are read only by functions sourced from
# detect-unlabeled-epics.sh, invisible to the linter.
# shellcheck disable=SC2034
