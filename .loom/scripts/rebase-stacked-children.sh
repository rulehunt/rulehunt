# Loom Stacked-PR Rebase-on-Parent-Amend (issue #3747, stacked-PR v2 item 3)
#
# Sibling of reconcile-stack.sh. Where reconcile-stack.sh handles the
# post-squash-merge moment (strip the parent's now-squashed commits off a child
# and retarget its base to the default branch), THIS script handles the much
# more common PRE-merge moment: a stacked parent's PR (feature/issue-<parent>)
# is still open and under review, Doctor amends the parent branch (interactive
# rewrite or additive commits + force-with-lease), and any child that branched
# off the parent's *pre-amend* tip is now silently stale. This tool detects that
# and rebases the stale children back onto the parent's current tip — WITHOUT
# retargeting the child PR's base (the child stays stacked on the parent).
#
# Usage:
#   ./.loom/scripts/rebase-stacked-children.sh <parent-branch> [--dry-run]
#
# Example:
#   ./.loom/scripts/rebase-stacked-children.sh feature/issue-3726
#
# What it does, per open child PR based on <parent-branch>:
#   1. Discovery — a LIVE forge query, identical shape to merge-pr.sh's
#      auto-reconcile / merge-ordering guard:
#        gh pr list --repo <nwo> --base <parent-branch> --state open
#   2. Staleness — git fetch, then `git merge-base --is-ancestor
#      origin/<parent-branch> origin/<child-branch>`. If the parent tip IS an
#      ancestor of the child, the child already has everything — skip. If NOT,
#      the child is stale relative to the parent's current tip.
#   3. Safe/unsafe split, keyed on the child ISSUE's loom:building label (fresh,
#      uncached `gh api` read — mirrors merge-pr.sh item 1):
#        - Safe   (child issue NOT loom:building): rebase directly —
#            git rebase origin/<parent-branch> <child-branch>
#            git push --force-with-lease
#          NO PR base retarget: the child's PR base stays <parent-branch>.
#        - Unsafe (child issue still loom:building): a live Builder likely has
#          the child branch checked out — skip the rebase (never force-push over
#          in-progress work) and post a deferred-rebase comment on the child PR.
#
# Safety:
#   - Uses --force-with-lease (NEVER a bare --force) so a concurrent push to the
#     child branch aborts rather than clobbers.
#   - --dry-run reports the per-child outcome (no-op / would-rebase / would-defer)
#     without executing any git/gh mutation.
#   - A rebase conflict on one child does NOT abort the whole run — it is a
#     normal, recoverable failure (final exit 2) with manual-recovery hints; the
#     conflicted rebase is aborted so remaining children still process.
#   - Refuses to run with a dirty working tree (a rebase would fail confusingly).
#   - GitHub-only, and only for a <parent-branch> matching feature/issue-<N>.
#
# Options:
#   --dry-run   Report the per-child outcome without executing git/gh mutations.
#   --help,-h   Show this help.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 = rebased, deferred, or no-op (or dry-run printed)
#   1 = usage / precondition failure
#   2 = a git/gh step failed (rebase conflict, rejected force-with-lease push)

Parent branch \`$parent_branch\` advanced (amended/pushed) after this child branched off it, so this PR is now **stale** relative to the parent's current tip. But issue #$child_issue is still \`loom:building\` — a Builder likely has this branch checked out. The auto-rebase was **skipped** to avoid racing that in-progress work with an out-of-band \`git rebase\` + \`push --force-with-lease\`.

**What happens next**: once issue #$child_issue is no longer \`loom:building\`, re-run this script to rebase the child onto the parent's current tip (the child's PR base stays \`$parent_branch\` — it remains stacked):
