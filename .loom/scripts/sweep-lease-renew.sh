# sweep-lease-renew.sh - Sweep-owned lease renewal loop (Issue #6180, Phase 1
# of Epic #6165: "give the forge claim a liveness dimension").
#
# ## Why this exists
#
# Epic #6165 gives the `loom:building` claim a liveness dimension: a "lease"
# comment on the claimed issue whose forge-assigned `updated_at` is the
# freshness signal a later phase (Phase 2) will read to decide whether a
# claim is still alive. Phase 1 is split into two write-only halves:
#
#   - Issue #6179 (sibling): the daemon writes the lease record ONCE, at the
#     moment `loom:building` is acquired (`SweepRegistry::write_lease_comment`
#     in `loom-daemon/src/sweep_registry/guards.rs`).
#   - Issue #6180 (this script): the SWEEP renews that record for its own
#     full lifetime.
#
# **The sweep renews its own lease — never the daemon.** Role agents run as
# transient scopes parented to `systemd --user` and routinely outlive the
# daemon that spawned them (loom#6129), so supervisor liveness is NOT the
# same thing as work liveness. If the daemon owned renewal, a daemon restart
# would let a live sweep's lease expire, and a peer host could reclaim work
# that was never actually abandoned — reproducing the exact bug this epic
# exists to fix, from a different direction. Renewal must therefore be driven
# by the process actually doing the work.
#
# ## Who may invoke `start` (amended by loom#7672)
#
# The rule above constrains **which process the loop watches**, not which
# process typed `start`. `loom-daemon` MAY invoke `start` — and does, once,
# in `SweepRegistry::finish_issue_dispatch`, immediately after spawning a
# `--claim-owned` sweep child, passing `--watch-pid <that child's pid>`
# (plus the `--host`/`--sweep-id` pair it published in the lease comment).
# That is a one-shot invocation, not ownership: `cmd_start` forks the loop,
# `disown`s it, and returns, so the daemon holds no handle and runs no tick;
# the loop's lifetime is pinned to the SWEEP's pid and a daemon restart
# leaves it running untouched. The hand-off exists because the previous
# arrangement — prose in sweep.md Step 1a asking the spawned LLM session to
# run `start` itself — failed exactly once in production and cost ~2.5h of
# fleet-wide claim/yield thrash plus a near-miss double-claim on a shared
# worktree (the downstream incident cited in loom#7672).
#
# What `loom-daemon` still must NEVER do is own ONGOING renewal — no
# tick-loop `renew-once`, no "re-arm every live sweep's renewal on startup".
# That, and only that, is what loom#6129 forbids.
#
# In-session callers (operator `/loom:sweep`, `--no-daemon`, GH Actions cron)
# have no dispatch code to do this for them and still invoke `start`
# themselves from `defaults/.claude/commands/loom/sweep.md` — Step 1b
# unconditionally, and Step 1a as a fallback when the dispatch's
# `LOOM_SWEEP_LEASE_RENEW_DISPATCHED` capability marker is absent (a
# pre-#7672 daemon binary, which rolls on a different cadence than the
# installed prompt).
#
# ## Marker format (coordinated with #6179)
#
# At the time this script was written, #6179 had not yet merged. The format
# below is the exact shape documented in #6179's own issue body (and mirrored
# in its in-flight draft of `defaults/docs/lease-record.md`), reproduced here
# so this script has a single, precise, testable contract regardless of merge
# order:
#
#   <!-- loom:lease host=<host> sweep=<sweep-id> -->
#   <free-form prose>
#
# The marker is the comment body's LITERAL FIRST LINE. Everything after it is
# free-form prose that machine readers (this script included) must never
# depend on for anything except locating the comment via
# `startswith("<!-- loom:lease host=")`. **The liveness signal is the
# comment's own forge-assigned `updated_at` timestamp — never a value
# embedded in the marker text.** This script never parses a timestamp out of
# the marker; it exists purely to make `gh` re-touch the comment so the
# forge advances `updated_at` on its own clock.
#
# ## What "renewal" means here
#
# GitHub does not reliably advance a comment's `updated_at` on a byte-for-
# byte-identical PATCH, so a true no-op PATCH would not be a safe renewal
# mechanism. Instead, `renew-once` rewrites a single trailing HTML-comment
# line (its own sub-marker, `<!-- loom:lease-renewed at=... -->`) with a
# fresh timestamp on every call, guaranteeing the body actually changes and
# `updated_at` genuinely advances — while leaving the FIRST-LINE lease marker
# byte-identical, so a `startswith()` reader never sees it move. Like the
# primary marker, `loom:lease-renewed`'s `at=` value is for human debugging
# ONLY; no reader may treat it as authoritative (the forge's own
# `updated_at` always is).
#
# This is an idempotent PATCH of the EXISTING comment — never a new comment.
# One dispatch writes exactly one lease comment (#6179); this script only
# ever edits that same comment, however many times it is called, so no
# duplicate comments accumulate on a long-running sweep.
#
# ## Commands
#
#   sweep-lease-renew.sh start <issue> [--interval SECS] [--watch-pid PID]
#                                       [--watch-ident TOKEN] [--max-age SECS]
#                                       [--host HOST] [--sweep-id ID]
#     Resolve a liveness PID (defaults to the same ancestor-walk
#     `resolve_liveness_pid` uses in sweep-run-registry.sh, i.e. the
#     long-lived `claude -p /loom:sweep ...` orchestrator process, NOT the
#     one-shot Bash-subshell PID of the tool call that invoked `start`), then
#     spawn ONE detached background loop that, every `--interval` seconds
#     (default 300 = 5 minutes; overridable via SWEEP_LEASE_RENEW_INTERVAL_SECS
#     too), best-effort renews the lease for <issue> as long as that PID is
#     still running THE SAME PROCESS. Prints the loop's own PID to stdout.
#     The loop is self-terminating in FOUR ways:
#       - once the watched PID is no longer alive, the loop exits on its own
#         next wake-up, so the lease record is never explicitly deleted -- it
#         simply ages out, exactly as the epic requires ("positive evidence,
#         not inference from a missing broadcast" applies to the RECLAIM
#         side; the renew side just stops broadcasting);
#       - once the watched PID's START-TIME IDENTITY stops matching the one
#         recorded at `start` time (Issue #7825), even though the PID NUMBER
#         is still live. A bare PID is not a durable handle: the kernel
#         recycles PID numbers, and a PID-only test flips permanently back to
#         "alive" the moment an unrelated process inherits the number. That is
#         what produced six orphan renewal loops (oldest 18 days) on one
#         worker, each keeping a long-dead sweep's claim looking fresh so no
#         peer host would ever reclaim it. `--watch-ident` pins the token
#         explicitly (a caller that already captured it at spawn time can
#         close the microsecond probe race); otherwise `start` probes it
#         itself;
#       - once the loop has been running longer than the ABSOLUTE age cap
#         (Issue #7825), regardless of what the watch test reports:
#         `--max-age SECS` / SWEEP_LEASE_RENEW_MAX_AGE_SECS, default 86400
#         (24 h), `0` = unbounded. This is the backstop that makes the whole
#         failure class bounded even if the liveness test is defeated again by
#         something nobody has anticipated;
#       - once a `renew-once` cycle reports the own-yield guard (exit 4 --
#         this dispatcher's own lease target has a matching
#         `loom:lease-yield` record, Issue #6485), the loop stops renewing
#         immediately rather than waiting for the watched PID to die. A
#         stood-down dispatcher must not keep a live-looking lease on work it
#         is not doing.
#     Nothing outside this script reaps the loop -- no daemon tick, no
#     reaper pass, no worktree-scoped orphan hunt can even see it (#7825 §3).
#     Self-termination is the ONLY mechanism, which is why it now has four
#     independent legs instead of one.
#     A genuinely FAILING renewal cycle (any `renew-once` exit other than 0,
#     2 "no lease comment", or 4 the own-yield guard -- e.g. a `gh api` 403
#     with an exhausted escalation ladder, Issue #6541) is logged with one
#     line identifying the issue and the exit code, so a failure is visible
#     instead of vanishing for the sweep's entire lease lifetime; the loop
#     itself still does not stop for it (same best-effort contract as before).
#     If --host/--sweep-id are NOT given explicitly, `start` first tries to
#     resolve them itself -- `--sweep-id` from `$LOOM_TERMINAL_ID` (set by
#     `loom-daemon` to `daemon-<sweep-id>` for every child it spawns, Issue
#     #6485) and `--host` via the same opaque-id transform
#     `sweep-lease-fence.sh`'s `resolve_published_host` uses, so a
#     daemon-dispatched sweep's own loop renews ONLY its own lease comment by
#     exact match. This closes a related failure mode observed alongside
#     #6485's own-yield race: without an exact match, `renew-once`'s
#     "newest wins" fallback can PATCH a DIFFERENT dispatcher's more-recently
#     -posted lease comment instead of this sweep's own -- so a live,
#     correctly-working renewal loop silently keeps a PEER's claim looking
#     fresh while its own claim's `updated_at` never advances. When neither
#     can be resolved (manual `/loom:sweep`, GH Actions cron, `--no-daemon`),
#     `start` falls back to the previous "newest wins" behavior unchanged.
#     `start` REFUSES (exit 1, no loop forked) a `--host`/`--sweep-id` pair
#     that cannot possibly match its own lease comment: either value
#     containing whitespace, or exactly one of the two given non-empty
#     (Issue #7876). Passing neither remains legal. That shape is what a
#     caller produces when it word-splits `sweep-lease-publish.sh publish`'s
#     "<host> <sweep-id>" line under zsh, which does not split unquoted
#     parameters -- and a loop that can never renew is worse than no loop,
#     because the caller believes renewal is running while the lease ages
#     out. Split that line with `read -r LEASE_HOST LEASE_SWEEP
#     <<<"$LEASE_IDENT"`, which behaves identically in bash and zsh.
#
#   sweep-lease-renew.sh renew-once <issue> [--host HOST] [--sweep-id ID]
#     Perform exactly one renewal cycle synchronously (used internally by
#     `start`'s loop; also directly testable). Locates the newest comment on
#     <issue> whose body starts with the lease marker prefix; if --host AND
#     --sweep-id are BOTH given, requires an exact match on the full marker
#     line (`host=<HOST> sweep=<ID> -->`) instead of "newest wins" — useful
#     when precision matters (e.g. tests, or a future multi-lease scenario).
#     Note (Issue #6322): the daemon publishes an OPAQUE `host=` id by
#     default now, not a raw hostname — an explicit --host here is compared
#     verbatim against the marker, so a caller wanting exact-match precision
#     must pass whatever value was actually published (see
#     `sweep-lease-fence.sh`'s `opaque_host_id`/`resolve_published_host` for
#     the bash-side helper that derives it). `start` now supplies an exact
#     --host/--sweep-id by default whenever it can resolve them (see below),
#     so "newest wins" is only reached as a fallback.
#
#     **Own-yield guard (Issue #6485).** Before PATCHing, the candidate lease
#     comment's OWN `host=`/`sweep=` pair (parsed from its first line, not
#     from the caller's --host/--sweep-id) is checked against every
#     `<!-- loom:lease-yield host=... sweep=... earliest_host=... -->`
#     comment already present in the same fetched batch. If a yield record
#     names the SAME (host, sweep) pair as the candidate lease, that
#     dispatcher has already stood down for this issue (Issue #6287's
#     claim-then-verify-order tie-break) and the candidate is never PATCHed
#     -- renewing it would keep a stood-down claim looking artificially
#     fresh next to the tie-break winner's own (possibly un-renewed) lease,
#     exactly the failure mode reported in #6485. Exits 4 in this case (see
#     below); this guard applies regardless of whether the caller passed
#     --host/--sweep-id or relied on "newest wins".
#     Exits 0 on a successful PATCH, 2 if no matching lease comment exists
#     (nothing to renew — not an error: a manually-launched sweep with no
#     daemon dispatch has no lease at all), 1 on a `gh`/network failure, 4 if
#     the candidate lease's own (host, sweep) has already posted a
#     `loom:lease-yield` record for this issue (own-yield guard above — not
#     an error, a normal stand-down outcome).
#
#   sweep-lease-renew.sh stop <PID>
#     Best-effort kill of a loop PID returned by `start`. NOT required for
#     correctness (the loop already self-terminates once its watched PID
#     dies, OR once its own renewal target's yield record appears -- see
#     `start` below) -- this only speeds up teardown for anyone who wants it.
#
# ## Scope
#
# Only issues that actually have a lease comment can be renewed. This script
# never CREATES a lease comment (that is exclusively #6179's write-on-dispatch
# path) -- `renew-once` finding nothing is a normal, silent no-op for any
# sweep not dispatched by `loom-daemon` (manual `/loom:sweep`, GH Actions
# cron, `--no-daemon`).
#
# Usage:
#   .loom/scripts/sweep-lease-renew.sh start 6180
#   .loom/scripts/sweep-lease-renew.sh renew-once 6180
#   .loom/scripts/sweep-lease-renew.sh stop 12345

# POSIX `kill(2)` has two distinct failure modes and a bare `kill -0` conflates
# them:
#   ESRCH — no such process        → genuinely dead, safe to prune.
#   EPERM — the process EXISTS but this caller may not signal it (different UID,

# `ps -p` answers "does this PID exist?" without needing signal permission, so it
# separates the two without parsing locale-dependent errno strings.

# the fast path returned "alive" and the `Z` branch was UNREACHABLE. The
# documented intent and the code now agree. `kill -0` survives only as the
# fallback for a host with no usable `ps`, never as the whole decision.

# `pid_start_identity` for this same PID. It is re-probed on every call; a
# mismatch — or an identity that can no longer be read at all — reports DEAD

    #   - `max_age_exceeded` stops the loop after $max_age seconds no matter
    #     what the watch test says. It is checked on BOTH sides of the sleep so
    #     a loop whose watch target is immortal still exits within one interval
    #     of the cap rather than at the next liveness transition (which, for an
    #     immortal target, never comes).
