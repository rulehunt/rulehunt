# sweep-lease-fence.sh - Sweep-side lease fencing check, run immediately
# before push / PR-open (Issue #6309, Phase 3 of Epic #6165: "give the forge
# claim a liveness dimension").
#
# ## Why this exists
#
# Epic #6165's Phase 1 (#6179/#6180) writes and renews a
# `<!-- loom:lease host=<host> sweep=<sweep-id> -->` marker comment for the
# life of a sweep (`defaults/docs/lease-record.md`,
# `defaults/docs/lease-renewal.md`). Phase 2 (#6286/#6287/#6288) made the
# DAEMON's reclamation path consult that lease's forge-assigned `updated_at`
# before reclaiming a peer's claim (`loom-daemon/src/claim_reconciliation.rs`
# — `lease_is_fresh` / `fetch_freshest_lease_updated_at`).
#
# Phase 3 (this script) is the sweep's OWN, symmetric check: fencing, not
# reclamation. A sweep about to do the one irreversible, externally-visible
# action -- push a branch / open a PR -- first confirms, against the forge's
# own clock, that its lease is still the one in force for the issue it is
# about to act on. This does not prevent an acquisition race (#4028) -- it
# stops an overlap from *costing* anything by capping waste at one build
# rather than N.
#
# **The sweep checks its own lease -- never the daemon.** Same rationale as
# Phase 1's renewal: role agents run as transient scopes that routinely
# outlive the daemon that spawned them (#6129), so only the sweep itself, at
# the moment of action, knows whether it is still the intended owner.
#
# ## What this checks
#
# Reads the FRESHEST comment on the target issue whose body starts with the
# lease marker (mirroring `loom-daemon`'s
# `claim_reconciliation::forge::fetch_freshest_lease_updated_at` /
# `sweep_registry::guards::read_lease_comments` read path -- REST comments
# endpoint, `--paginate`, NDJSON output to survive Issue #4637's per-page
# `--jq` re-invocation), then confirms BOTH:
#
#   1. FRESH: `now - updated_at <= ttl_minutes` (default 15, the same TTL
#      Phase 2 uses -- `LEASE_TTL_MINUTES_ENV` in claim_reconciliation.rs --
#      overridable here via `--ttl-minutes` or `LOOM_LEASE_TTL_MINUTES`).
#   2. OWNED: the freshest lease's `host=` field equals this sweep's own
#      host identity (no other host's lease has superseded this one via a
#      reclaim or a race).
#
# On failure of EITHER condition, `check` exits non-zero (distinct codes for
# each failure reason, see below) and logs which condition failed plus the
# observed lease state, so a post-incident read can tell "expired" apart
# from "superseded by another host". It does NOT attempt to clean up or
# contest the peer's claim -- the label/claim is left alone; that is out of
# scope for this phase.
#
# ## Yielded leases are excluded from "freshest" (Issue #6485)
#
# A lease comment whose own `(host, sweep)` pair has a LATER
# `<!-- loom:lease-yield host=... sweep=... earliest_host=... -->` comment on
# the same issue (Issue #6287's claim-then-verify-order tie-break standdown)
# is never eligible to be picked as "the freshest lease" -- it is dropped
# from the candidate pool entirely before the freshest-by-`updated_at`
# selection runs. Without this, a stood-down dispatcher whose renewal loop
# keeps PATCHing its own (abandoned) lease record -- or, per #6485's own
# incident, ANOTHER host's renewal loop that mistakenly targets it under
# "newest wins" (see `sweep-lease-renew.sh`) -- can look artificially
# fresher than the tie-break WINNER's own, correctly-owned, but less
# frequently renewed lease, fencing the winner out of its own push/PR-open.
# This is matched by exact `(host, sweep)` pair, not by host alone, so a
# host that legitimately re-claims the SAME issue later (a brand new lease
# comment, a different `sweep=`) is never excluded by an unrelated, older
# yield from a past claim episode on that same host. A genuinely abandoned
# lease that was never yielded (no `loom:lease-yield` record at all) is
# NEVER excluded by this rule -- it still ages out purely via the ordinary
# TTL-based path below (EXPIRED aborts only when it is THIS sweep's own
# host's lease; an expired lease owned by a different host now PASSes as
# stale, no-longer-live evidence instead, Issue #6783), so this does not
# weaken TTL-based reclamation.
#
# On success (or when there is simply no evidence to fence against -- see
# "Fail-open cases" below), `check` exits 0 and the caller proceeds exactly
# as it would have before this script existed.
#
# ## Where this is wired in
#
# `defaults/.claude/commands/loom/sweep.md`'s Builder phase, immediately
# before `git push` + `./.loom/scripts/create-pr.sh` (see "Creating the PR"
# in `defaults/roles/builder-pr.md`). Meaningful for BOTH dispatch paths
# since #6320: a daemon-dispatched sweep's lease is written at dispatch
# (Step 1a's self-claim signal, #6179), and an in-session sweep (manual
# `/loom:sweep`, GH Actions cron, `--no-daemon`) publishes its own at
# pre-flight Step 1b (`sweep-lease-publish.sh`). Only a run that predates
# those writers -- or one whose lease write failed -- has nothing to fence
# against, and this check fails open for it (see "Fail-open cases").
#
# ## Fail-open cases (never block on unverifiable evidence)
#
# Per `defaults/docs/lease-record.md`'s own reader contract, the ABSENCE of a
# lease record is "no evidence", never "not fresh" -- and every other forge
# probe in this lease subsystem (`fetch_freshest_lease_updated_at`,
# `read_lease_comments`) fails open on a `gh`/network error rather than
# blocking. This script mirrors that posture exactly:
#
#   - No lease comment found at all on the issue -> PASS (exit 0).
#   - The freshest lease comment fails to parse (malformed marker) -> PASS.
#   - The `gh api` call itself fails (network, rate limit, auth) -> PASS.
#   - The freshest lease comment is EXPIRED (older than ttl-minutes) AND
#     belongs to a host OTHER THAN this sweep's own -> PASS (Issue #6783,
#     see below).
#
# Only a lease that is either (a) expired AND owned by THIS sweep's own host,
# or (b) fresh but held by a DIFFERENT host, causes an abort. This is
# deliberate: a false abort (blocking a legitimately-owned sweep on a
# transient `gh` hiccup, or on a dead peer's abandoned record) is a strictly
# worse failure mode here than an occasional missed fence -- the fence is a
# cost-bounding backstop for a rare race, not a correctness-critical lock.
#
# ### Expired lease, different host (Issue #6783)
#
# Prior to #6783, ANY expired freshest lease -- regardless of which host
# wrote it -- aborted with exit `3` (EXPIRED). But EXPIRED is an abort, not a
# pass: if the lease's own sweep died without ever renewing OR yielding it,
# the record never stops being the freshest lease comment on the issue (it is
# never superseded unless a successor sweep writes a lease of its own), so it
# permanently fenced out every future dispatch -- observed on issue #6694 /
# PR #6773, where a dead sweep's lease from a different, dead host blocked a
# legitimate successor with zero live competitors.
#
# An expired lease is, by definition, not evidence of a LIVE peer -- it is
# exactly the state `loom-daemon`'s own `claim_reconciliation.rs` treats as
# reclaimable, and closer to "no evidence" (per this doc's own reader
# contract, `defaults/docs/lease-record.md`) than to "a peer owns this". So:
#
#   - Expired AND owned by THIS sweep's own host -> still ABORT (exit `3`).
#     A sweep whose own renewal loop died should not trust its own claim --
#     it may have been legitimately reclaimed out from under it.
#   - Expired AND owned by a DIFFERENT host -> now PASS (exit `0`). Nobody
#     live holds the claim; the abandoned record is no longer treated as
#     fencing evidence.
#
# Exit `4` (SUPERSEDED -- a different, FRESH lease from a live peer) is
# unaffected by this change: that case still means a live peer genuinely
# holds the claim, and aborting there remains unambiguously correct.
#
# ## Commands
#
#   sweep-lease-fence.sh check <issue> [--host HOST] [--ttl-minutes N]
#     Perform the fencing check for <issue>. --host defaults to the PUBLISHED
#     form of this host's own identity (Issue #6322): the opaque id
#     (`opaque_host_id`, mirroring `sweep_registry::opaque_host_id` byte for
#     byte) of the raw identity `sweep_registry::host_identity()` resolves
#     (`LOOM_HOST_ID` env > `$HOSTNAME` > the `hostname` binary >
#     `unknown-host`) -- unless `LOOM_LEASE_PUBLISH_HOSTNAME` opts into raw
#     publishing, in which case the raw identity is used directly, matching
#     `write_lease_comment`'s own opt-in. An explicit --host is used verbatim
#     (no transform applied) -- it is the caller's job to pass whatever value
#     was actually published. --ttl-minutes defaults to
#     `LOOM_LEASE_TTL_MINUTES` or 15 (Phase 2's default,
#     `DEFAULT_LEASE_TTL_MINUTES` in claim_reconciliation.rs).
#
#     Exit codes:
#       0  PASS -- proceed with push / PR-open. Covers: fresh lease owned by
#          this host; no lease comment found; a lease comment that failed to
#          parse; a `gh` fetch failure; or an EXPIRED lease owned by a
#          DIFFERENT host (all fail-open, see above and Issue #6783).
#       1  Usage error (bad issue number, unknown flag, non-numeric
#          --ttl-minutes).
#       3  ABORT: EXPIRED -- the freshest lease comment is older than
#          ttl-minutes AND belongs to THIS sweep's own host (Issue #6783: an
#          expired lease owned by a different host now PASSes instead, see
#          above).
#       4  ABORT: SUPERSEDED -- the freshest lease comment is still FRESH but
#          its host= differs from this sweep's own host.
#
# Usage:
#   .loom/scripts/sweep-lease-fence.sh check 6309
