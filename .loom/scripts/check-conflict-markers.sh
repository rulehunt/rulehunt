#
# #6499: an abandoned `git stash pop` conflict left live conflict markers
# (`<<<<<<< Updated upstream` / `=======` / `>>>>>>> Stashed changes`) in the
# tracked, host-patched `.loom/config.json` on two fleet hosts. Nothing
# stopped them from being COMMITTED — a later `chore: resync installed Loom
# surfaces` pass swept the corrupted file into a commit on `main`, where every
# working-tree-state guard is structurally blind to it:
#
#   - `check-main-clean.sh`'s abandoned-conflict detection (#6162 AC3) and
#     `primary_checkout_reaper`'s periodic counterpart (#6499) both key on an
#     UNMERGED INDEX ENTRY (`git status --porcelain` XY in DD/AU/UD/UA/DU/AA/
#     UU). Once the conflicted content is `git add`ed and committed, the index
#     is merged again and both detectors correctly report nothing.
#   - `check-shell-syntax.sh` (#6162) catches the same corruption shape, but
#     only in `*.sh` files, via `bash -n`. `.loom/config.json` is JSON.
#
# This script is the content-level gate that covers the committed case for
# every tracked file regardless of extension. A line-start `<<<<<<< ` or
# `>>>>>>> ` in a tracked file is never legitimate content — it is always a
# conflict left unresolved.
#
# Consequence of missing it, for the file that triggered #6499: an
# unparseable `.loom/config.json` makes the daemon's `config_resolver` fall
# back to `{}` for that tier, silently running on built-in defaults for every
# block the file carried — observability, safehouse, `autonomous.roleRunner`.
# On the original incident the fleet dashboard showed a host stale for ~70
# minutes while its probe still reported UP.
#
# Opting a file out (fixtures that MUST contain markers): a file containing
# the literal string
#
#     check-conflict-markers:allow
#
# anywhere in its content is skipped. This is deliberately an in-file opt-out
# rather than a path allowlist in this script: a test that constructs a
# conflicted fixture declares its own exemption next to the fixture, so the
# exemption cannot outlive the file or drift from it.
#
# Usage:
#   ./.loom/scripts/check-conflict-markers.sh            # scan tracked files
#   ./.loom/scripts/check-conflict-markers.sh --dir <p>  # scan <p> recursively (repeatable)
#   ./.loom/scripts/check-conflict-markers.sh --quiet    # only print failures
#   ./.loom/scripts/check-conflict-markers.sh --self-test
#   ./.loom/scripts/check-conflict-markers.sh --help
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 - no tracked file carries conflict markers (including "found zero files").
#   1 - usage error, or not inside a git repository (default mode).
#   2 - one or more files carry conflict markers - every offender is named
#       with the offending line numbers.
#
# Notes:
#   - Default mode scans `git ls-files` of the repo containing $PWD, so it
#     works identically from the primary checkout and from a linked worktree
#     (each scans its own checked-out content, which is what a pre-merge CI
#     gate wants - unlike check-shell-syntax.sh, whose default mode
#     deliberately reaches for the PRIMARY checkout's INSTALLED copies).
#   - A bare `=======` line is NOT flagged on its own: it is a legitimate
#     markdown setext heading underline and a common shell/comment separator.
#     Git always emits `<<<<<<< ` and `>>>>>>> ` alongside it, so keying on
#     those two (at line start, with the trailing space git always writes
#     before the branch/stash label) is both sufficient and false-positive-free.
#   - Binary files are skipped (`grep -I`), so this never chokes on a tracked
#     image or archive.
