# Loom Cleanup Script - Remove build artifacts and orphaned worktrees
#
# AGENT USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
#   This script cleans up Loom build artifacts and orphaned worktrees.
#
#   Non-interactive mode (for Claude Code):
#     ./scripts/cleanup.sh --yes
#     ./scripts/cleanup.sh -y
#
#   Interactive mode (prompts for confirmation):
#     ./scripts/cleanup.sh
#
#   What this script does:
#     1. Removes target/ directory (Rust build artifacts)
#     2. Removes node_modules/ directory (Node dependencies)
#     3. Detects worktrees for closed issues and offers to remove them
#     4. Prunes orphaned git worktrees (with confirmation unless --yes)
#
#   After running, restore dependencies with: pnpm install

set -e  # Exit on error

# Parse command line arguments
NON_INTERACTIVE=false
