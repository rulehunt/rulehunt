# check-main-clean.sh - Backstop guard: fail if the MAIN worktree is dirty.
#
# Detects the #2802 / #3513 failure mode where a Builder agent's cwd resets
# between tool calls and a repo-relative Write/Edit/Bash file operation lands
# in the MAIN repository working tree instead of the issue worktree under
# .loom/worktrees/issue-N. The builder guidance (builder.md / builder-worktree.md)
# is the primary defense (capture the absolute worktree path once, use absolute
# paths everywhere). This script is the BACKSTOP: run it after the builder phase
# and before opening a PR. If the main worktree has uncommitted changes, the
# builder has contaminated main and the sweep should abort.
#
# It resolves the MAIN worktree from anywhere — including from inside an issue
# worktree — via `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`, so it works whether invoked
# from the repo root or from a worktree.
#
# Abandoned-conflict detection (#6162):
#   Before any snapshot/baseline/plain/quarantine logic runs, this script also
#   checks for an unmerged index entry (`git status --porcelain` XY in
#   DD/AU/UD/UA/DU/AA/UU) with NO merge or rebase actually in progress
#   (MERGE_HEAD, rebase-merge/, rebase-apply/ all absent) — an agent's merge
#   or `git stash pop` hit a conflict and was walked away from instead of
#   resolved or aborted (the #6162 incident: an abandoned stash-pop conflict
#   left live `<<<<<<<`/`=======`/`>>>>>>>` markers in a script that a resync
#   would have shipped fleet-wide). This is a DISTINCT, more urgent report
#   than ordinary dirt (which already technically flags a `UU` line, but with
#   a generic "dirty" message that doesn't name a working restore path) —
#   see the "Abandoned-conflict detection" block below for the exact
#   condition and remediation. It is never safe to --baseline away or
#   --quarantine (an unmerged index entry breaks `git stash push`), so it
#   always hard-exits (EXIT_MAIN_DIRTY) rather than flowing into either.
#

#
# Baseline mechanism (#3648):
#   The plain (no-arg) check treats ANY uncommitted change on main as builder
#   contamination. That false-positives when the main worktree carried
#   pre-existing, unrelated dirt (a regenerated lockfile, a scratch edit) before
#   the sweep even started. The baseline mechanism lets a caller (e.g. /loom:sweep)
#   snapshot main's porcelain state ONCE at sweep start, then pass that snapshot
#   as a --baseline on each post-wave check. Only changes that appeared AFTER the
#   snapshot (set difference on exact porcelain lines) are treated as
#   contamination; pre-existing dirt is ignored.
#
#     ./.loom/scripts/check-main-clean.sh --snapshot .loom/main-clean-baseline.txt   # once, before wave 1
#     ./.loom/scripts/check-main-clean.sh --baseline .loom/main-clean-baseline.txt   # after each builder
#
#   Fail-safe: if the --baseline FILE is missing or unreadable, the check warns
#   to stderr and falls back to the plain whole-status behavior (never a silent
#   pass). With NO --baseline/--snapshot argument, behavior is byte-for-byte
#   identical to the pre-#3648 whole-status hard-fail — the builder.md /
#   builder-worktree.md manual call sites depend on that contract.
#
# Quarantine mode (#4380):
#   Detection alone leaves remediation to whoever reads the failure — historically
#   an ad-hoc, per-file `git checkout --` restore that can (and did) stop half
#   way, leaving main in a state that is neither the pre-sweep baseline nor the
#   builder's intended change. `--quarantine` makes remediation ATOMIC and
#   LOGGED: on detecting new dirt, every offending path (tracked AND untracked)
#   is moved to a stash rescue ref in ONE `git stash push --include-untracked`
#   operation, and exactly one structured JSON line is emitted describing what
#   was quarantined and where it went.
#
#     ./.loom/scripts/check-main-clean.sh --baseline "$MAIN_CLEAN_BASELINE" \
#         --quarantine --label "run=$RUN_ID issue=$N"
#
#   - It is a RESCUE, never a discard: the full diff survives in the stash
#     (`git stash list` / `git stash show -p <ref>`), so the work can be replayed
#     into the correct worktree. Nothing is ever deleted.
#   - Only paths the check flagged as NEW are stashed. Pre-existing (baselined)
#     dirt is passed to `git stash push` as an explicit pathspec exclusion — an
#     operator's unrelated working-tree edits are never swept up.
#   - `--label TEXT` keys the stash message (e.g. the sweep RUN_ID + issue
#     number) so a quarantined stash is attributable to the builder that caused
#     it. Defaults to `$LOOM_QUARANTINE_LABEL`, else "unattributed".
#   - `--log FILE` appends the same one-line JSON entry to FILE (best effort;
#     never fails the check). Defaults to `<main>/.loom/logs/main-quarantine.log`
#     when that directory exists.
#   - Forge breadcrumb (#5691): on a SUCCESSFUL quarantine, if `--label` carries
#     an `issue=N` field (the run-id/issue-number attribution every caller
#     already passes, e.g. `run=$RUN_ID issue=$N`), a best-effort
#     `gh issue comment N` is posted naming the stashed paths, the host, and the
#     stash ref/commit — so an operator (or the issue's own history) has a
#     forge-visible trail back to `stash@{N}` on a specific host, not just the
#     structured log line. A missing/unauthenticated `gh`, a label with no
#     `issue=` field (e.g. the post-wave `run=... wave=...` label), or a failed
#     API call are all silent no-ops that never change this check's exit code;
#     the attempt's own outcome is recorded as a distinct
#     `"event":"main-clean.quarantine-comment"` log line. Opt out entirely with
#     `LOOM_QUARANTINE_COMMENT=0`.
#   - Exit 4 (not 3) on a SUCCESSFUL quarantine: main is provably back at the
#     baseline, so the caller can log and continue rather than hard-blocking. If
#     the quarantine could not be completed, the exit stays 3 (hard-block).
#   - `--quarantine` is intended with `--baseline`. It is accepted without one,
#     in which case ALL non-Loom-owned dirt in main is quarantined (still a
#     rescue ref, but with no notion of "pre-existing" to protect). It is a
#     usage error with `--snapshot`.
#   - Immediately before the `git stash push`, the offending path set is
#     RE-DERIVED from a fresh `git status` (#5185). The first snapshot is taken
#     earlier in the run, and on a busy host the dirt it describes can be
#     resolved in between (a concurrent sweep, the builder's own commit, a
#     cleanup pass). Pushing the stale pathspec anyway produced either a
#     misattributed no-op — `git stash push` prints "No local changes to save",
#     exits 0, creates nothing, and the old success path then reported the
#     PREVIOUS entry's sha as the rescue ref — or, where git allowed it, an
#     EMPTY stash entry carrying no information. Since `git stash` shares one
#     reflog across every linked worktree, each such entry buries the real ones
#     further down a stack nobody can safely prune. When the re-derivation finds
#     nothing left to quarantine, NO stash is pushed and a distinct
#     `"result":"no_op"` event is logged (exit 0 — main is provably at the
#     baseline). A stash that is somehow still created empty is logged as
#     `"result":"quarantined_empty"`, so the race stays visible instead of
#     masquerading as an ordinary quarantine.
#
# Listing outstanding quarantine stashes (#5185):
#   A quarantine is recorded in the structured log, but the rescue stash itself
#   had no operator-facing surface — entries accumulated unreconciled (29 on one
#   host, oldest 7 days) and were only ever noticed by accident. `--list-quarantined`
#   is that surface: a read-only report of every Loom-produced stash entry
#   outstanding in the MAIN worktree.
#
#     ./.loom/scripts/check-main-clean.sh --list-quarantined          # human-readable
#     ./.loom/scripts/check-main-clean.sh --list-quarantined --json   # machine-readable
#
#   - Matches by stash MESSAGE, so it covers every Loom producer, not just this
#     script (see LOOM_STASH_PATTERNS below — the Auditor's drift shelf uses its
#     own prefix).
#   - Reports each entry's commit sha (indices shift as the shared stack grows),
#     relative age, producer, the `issue=`/`run=` attribution parsed out of the
#     message, and whether the entry is EMPTY (nothing was actually captured).
#   - Read-only: it never pops, drops, or otherwise mutates the shared stash
#     stack. Exit 0 whether or not anything is outstanding — it is a report, not
#     a gate, so `loom status` can surface the count without risking a failure.
#   - `./.loom/bin/loom status` calls it to show a "Quarantined work" section, so
#     an outstanding quarantine is discoverable without knowing one happened.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 - Main worktree is clean (or, in --baseline mode, only pre-existing dirt
#       remains); or a --snapshot completed successfully; or a --quarantine
#       found nothing left to quarantine and created no stash (the `no_op`
#       result, #5185); or a --list-quarantined report completed (always 0 —
#       it is a report, not a gate).
#   2 - Usage error or could not resolve the main worktree (not a git repo).
#   3 - Main worktree is DIRTY: uncommitted changes detected (the contamination
#       this guard exists to catch). In --baseline mode, only NEW changes count.
#       Also returned when a requested --quarantine could NOT be completed.
#   4 - Main worktree WAS dirty and the new dirt was successfully quarantined to
#       a stash rescue ref (--quarantine only). Main is back at the baseline.
#
# Notes:
#   - "Dirty" means `git status --porcelain` on the MAIN worktree returns any
#     output: staged, unstaged, or untracked files all count. A builder working
#     correctly in its own worktree leaves the main worktree pristine.
#   - Issue worktrees live under <main>/.loom/worktrees/ which is gitignored, so
#     their existence does NOT make the main worktree dirty.
#   - Does NOT adopt the installed-surface byte-match ignore class added to
#     `main_health_gate.rs`'s `is_ignorable_dirt` (#4332) — a deliberate
#     divergence, not an oversight. That class exists to protect a *different*
#     property: "this dirt is provably `resync-installed.sh` output, not an
#     operator hand-edit worth halting the dispatch gate over." This script's
#     job is the opposite kind of check — catching a *builder* accidentally
#     writing into the MAIN worktree instead of its issue worktree (#2802 /
#     #3513) — and a builder-written file that happens to byte-match
#     `defaults/` is still a real out-of-worktree write bug the backstop must
#     not mask. It would also be a no-op in the common case anyway: this
#     script is the manual/consumer-repo backstop and most consumer installs
#     have no local `defaults/` tree to byte-match against.

# ---- Loom-owned transient state paths (#3778) ----------------------------
# Runtime bookkeeping the sweep orchestrator itself writes under .loom/ during a

# gitignored in Loom's *source* .gitignore, but a consumer repo's installed
# loom-managed .gitignore block can drift out of sync and omit newer entries —
# so the same transient surfaces as an untracked path and false-positives this
# backstop as "builder contamination" (observed in rjwalters/anvil, #3778).
# Rather than depend on the consumer's .gitignore being current, exclude the
# known Loom-owned transient paths internally, unconditionally. None of these is
# source a builder should ever be writing to main, so filtering them can never
# mask real contamination. Prefixes ending in "/" match a directory subtree; the
# others match an exact path. Keep roughly in sync with the loom-managed block in

# combinations git uses for an unmerged path) with NO merge/rebase actually
# in progress (MERGE_HEAD, rebase-merge/, rebase-apply/ all absent from the
# git dir) means an agent popped a stash / attempted a merge, hit a conflict,
# and walked away without resolving OR aborting — exactly the #6162
# incident: an abandoned `git stash pop` conflict left live `<<<<<<<` /
# `=======` / `>>>>>>>` markers in defaults/scripts/spawn-claude.sh, which
# `resync-installed.sh` would then have shipped fleet-wide.
#
# Generic `git status --porcelain` dirty-detection already technically
# covers this — a `UU ` line is not excluded by is_loom_owned, so it would
# already trip the plain/baseline "dirty" path below — but a bare "main
# worktree is dirty" message does not tell an operator this is a stuck
# conflict, nor that the standard "git checkout -- <path>" restore does not
# work on an unmerged path. This block reports it as its own, more specific
# and more urgent condition, with remediation that actually applies.
#
# Runs unconditionally for every mode that reaches this point (snapshot,
# baseline, plain, quarantine — --list-quarantined already returned above,
# since it is a read-only stash report unrelated to the working tree) and
# BEFORE any baseline/quarantine logic: an abandoned conflict is never safe
# to baseline away (it is never "pre-existing dirt" worth ignoring) or to
# quarantine automatically (`git stash push` against an unmerged index entry
# is unreliable), so it hard-exits directly rather than flowing into either.
