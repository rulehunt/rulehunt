# Loom Operator-Gate Advisory Scan for /loom:sweep all (#5137)
#
# The `all` sentinel's aggressive candidate taxonomy hard-skips two label
# classes (`loom:operator-only` and, since #5817, `loom:needs-capability`)
# and treats every other open issue as a buildable candidate. Some issues
# declare operator-gating in their BODY TEXT ("the index is login-walled, so
# acquisition is operator-gated", "Operator decision: send this paired with
# the paper") without carrying either label — so the sentinel would plan to
# dispatch them as ordinary build candidates. Some declare it in their TITLE
# instead ("Operator: visit the county archive and photograph the 1850
# census page") with a body that contains none of the phrase vocabulary
# below — a real 2026-08-17 sweep run missed exactly this shape (#6391).
#
# This tool scans each candidate's already-fetched `body` (the same field the
# survey fetches for ## Affected Files overlap estimation, #4161, and
# Depends on / Requires edge detection, #3759 — no new API call) plus the
# candidate's `title` (one extra `gh issue view --json title` read per
# candidate, #6391) for three independent, ADVISORY-ONLY signals:
#
#   1. Direct phrase match — the body itself contains an instruction-shaped
#      operator-gate fragment (see PHRASES below). Case-insensitive.
#   2. Dependency match — the body declares `Depends on #A` / `Requires #A`
#      (the same restricted vocabulary #3759's --auto-stack and #3747's
#      warn-out-of-set-deps.sh both reuse) and #A currently carries the
#      `loom:operator-only` OR `loom:needs-capability` label — the #87 -> #4
#      shape from the issue: the sweep would skip the prerequisite as
#      operator-only (or needs-capability), then dispatch the dependent that
#      needs it.
#   3. Title-prefix match (#6391) — the title itself, after stripping leading
#      whitespace/markdown decoration, STARTS WITH `Operator:` / `Operator —`
#      / `Operator-only` (see TITLE_PREFIXES below). Case-insensitive. A
#      PREFIX match, not a substring-anywhere match — a title that merely
#      contains "operator" mid-sentence ("Fix operator dashboard rendering")
#      does not match. Checked independently of the body, so it still fires
#      when the body is empty or contains none of the PHRASES vocabulary.
#
# ADVISORY ONLY: this tool never hard-skips a candidate, never mutates a
# label, and never blocks the sweep. It only ANNOTATES the confirmation-gate
# listing so the operator can decide. It always exits 0.
#
# Usage:
#   warn-operator-gated.sh --candidates "<N ...>" [--repo <nwo>]
#
# Example:
#   warn-operator-gated.sh --candidates "87 65 64 73"
#
# Output (stdout, one line per MATCHING candidate — silent for the rest):
#   <N>\t<annotation>
# where <annotation> is one of:
#   ⚠ body declares operator-gating: "<matched phrase>"
#   ⚠ depends on #<A>, which is loom:operator-only
#   ⚠ depends on #<A>, which is loom:needs-capability
#   ⚠ title declares operator-gating: "<matched prefix>"
# A candidate matching more than one signal prints one line per signal; a
# dependency carrying BOTH labels prints one dependency line per label
# (deduplicated by label, in declared order).
#
# Zero matches across the whole candidate set -> zero lines of output, and the
# caller's plan/listing is byte-for-byte unchanged from before this tool
# existed (per #5137's own acceptance criterion).
#
# Options:
#   --candidates "<N ...>"  Space-separated candidate issue numbers (required).
#   --repo <nwo>            Repo owner/name (optional; defaults to the current repo).
#   --help,-h               Show this help.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 = always (advisory, non-blocking) — including when matches were emitted.
#   1 = usage / precondition failure (e.g. missing --candidates).

# ---- phrase vocabulary (extracted by tests) ----
# Instruction-shaped operator-gate fragments (case-insensitive), matched on
# word/phrase boundaries rather than a bare substring — the same discipline
# the loom:blocked taxonomy row already applies to `hold until` / `wait
# until` / `defer` (avoiding false positives like "waiting on CI"). The
# issue's own "credentials" candidate phrasing is narrowed here to "requires
# credentials" / "needs credentials" for the same reason: a bare "credentials"
# substring would false-positive on unrelated text like "store credentials in
# .env" or "credentials are already configured".
#
# The "human action" pair (#6198) is narrowed the same way: agents commonly
# open an operator-task body with "**Operator task — requires human action, not
# automation.**", which `requires operator` misses by one word. `requires human
# action` / `needs human action` are instruction-shaped; a bare `human`
# substring would false-positive on ordinary prose like "the human-in-the-loop
# design" or "a human reviews the diff".
