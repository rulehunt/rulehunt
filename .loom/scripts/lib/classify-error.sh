# classify-error.sh — Classify a (output, exit_code, [provider]) triple into
# an error category.
#
# Source this file (do not exec). Defines two public functions:
#
#   classification_is_transient <category> -> exit 0 when a caller's retry loop
#       should retry, 1 when the category is terminal. THE single source of
#       truth for every retry decision (issue #4501) — see the function's own
#       comment for the deny-list policy and why no caller may keep a private
#       pattern list alongside it.
#
#   classify_error <output> <exit_code> [provider] -> echoes one of:
#       SUCCESS         — exit 0 (regardless of output content)
#       TIMEOUT         — exit 124/137 (productive cycle, not a failure)
#       CWD_DELETED     — working directory was removed
#       TOKEN_EXPIRED   — 401 / OAuth token expired (skip this token). Also
#                         covers two account-level death phrasings folded in
#                         by issue #6424 rather than a new category (identical
#                         remedy: mark bad, rotate, needs human
#                         re-authorization): "organization has disabled
#                         [Claude subscription access]" and "Failed to
#                         authenticate ... socket connection was closed
#                         unexpectedly".
#       TOKEN_EXHAUSTED — quota/weekly/per-model limit hit (rotate). Covers
#                         both the "hit your … limit" family (#3738) and the
#                         per-model "reached your <model> limit" ceiling the
#                         CLI emits today (#4501) — the latter is a safe
#                         over-approximation (the account may still have
#                         headroom on a cheaper model) chosen over a new
#                         model-dimensioned category so no downstream consumer
#                         has to learn a new enum value.
#       MODEL_CREDITS_EXHAUSTED
#                       — per-model-TIER usage credits ran out (issue #5687):
#                         "You're out of usage credits". Distinct from
#                         TOKEN_EXHAUSTED because the remedy differs in KIND,
#                         not just degree: credits are scoped to a model tier,
#                         so re-dispatching the SAME work on a CHEAPER model
#                         under the SAME account is a valid (often the only
#                         available) remedy — account rotation is not the only
#                         option, and on a single-account host it is not an
#                         option at all. Every account-pool consumer treats it
#                         exactly like TOKEN_EXHAUSTED (rotate, same cooldown,
#                         same retryability), so the daemon path is unchanged;
#                         the distinct NAME exists so the in-session
#                         `/loom:sweep` orchestrator — which dispatches wave
#                         builders through the Task tool and never runs this
#                         classifier as a subprocess — has a precise signature
#                         to key its one-rung-down model fallback on (see
#                         sweep.md, "Credit-exhaustion fallback"), and so
#                         sweep forensics can name the failure class.
#       SESSION_LIMIT   — concurrent-session-limit fault (issue #3947): the
#                         account is NOT out of quota, it just cannot start
#                         another *simultaneous* session right now (a capacity
#                         fault from per-token session stacking). Callers must
#                         re-select a different account and retry WITHOUT
#                         marking the token bad — poisoning .bad_tokens for a
#                         transient concurrency limit would wrongly shrink the
#                         healthy pool. Classified BEFORE TOKEN_EXHAUSTED so the
#                         "session limit" wording is not swallowed by the
#                         weekly/usage-limit regex.
#       MODEL_REFUSAL   — model safety classifier refused the turn
#                         (stop_reason "refusal" on a non-zero-exit run);
#                         a routing error, not a quality signal — the sweep
#                         orchestrator drops one ladder rung (e.g. fable→opus)
#                         WITHOUT consuming a Doctor cycle (see sweep.md).
#       RECOVERABLE     — transient (rate limit, 5xx, network, etc.)
#       FATAL           — non-recoverable: retrying the same invocation cannot
#                         succeed because the fault is in the CONFIGURATION,
#                         not the transport or the account. Never returned for
#                         provider `claude` (its table has no FATAL patterns),
#                         so the pre-#4468 claim "currently never returned"
#                         still holds for every Claude caller. The `codex`
#                         table (issue #4468) is the first to use it — e.g.
#                         Codex's trusted-directory refusal and an
#                         unknown-config-key rejection, both of which loop
#                         forever under a RECOVERABLE retry.
#
# Design — engine vs. provider pattern tables (issue #4190):
#   classify_error() is a two-layer design: a shared CLASSIFICATION ENGINE
#   (exit-code-first ordering, the category enum, and the generic-transient
#   fallthrough) plus provider-scoped PATTERN TABLES that hold the actual
#   failure-signature regexes. This keeps a future non-Claude runtime adapter
#   (Codex, Amp, ... — see #4167) additive: register a new provider table
#   instead of editing the shared engine. Both the `claude` and `codex` tables
#   are populated today (the latter filled in by epic #4167 Phase 2, issue
#   #4468, alongside `defaults/scripts/spawn-codex.sh`).
#
#   Provider selector precedence (highest first): optional 3rd positional
#   arg > `$LOOM_RUNTIME` (the same env var `spawn-worker.sh` uses for
#   runtime dispatch, see `.loom/docs/runtime-adapters.md`) > default
#   `"claude"`. Two-arg calls (e.g. `claude-wrapper.sh`, which sources this
#   file and calls `classify_error "$1" "$2"`) are therefore unaffected and
#   classify bit-identically to before this split — this file intentionally
#   does NOT introduce a `LOOM_WORKER` selector (that name belongs to an
#   older fork design; upstream's convention is `LOOM_RUNTIME`).
#
#   An unrecognized provider never errors — it simply has no provider-specific
#   matches and falls straight through to the shared generic-transient table
#   below. Provider tables are ordered case dispatch
#   (sequential pattern checks), NOT associative-array iteration, so match
#   order is always deterministic — bash does not guarantee iteration order
#   for associative arrays.
#
#   Within the `claude` table, match order is significant and preserved from
#   the pre-split implementation: CWD_DELETED -> MODEL_REFUSAL ->
#   TOKEN_EXPIRED -> SESSION_LIMIT -> TOKEN_EXHAUSTED ->
#   MODEL_CREDITS_EXHAUSTED -> the "No messages returned" RECOVERABLE case.
#   MODEL_CREDITS_EXHAUSTED is checked LAST among the account-side categories
#   (#5687) so every pre-existing vector keeps its pre-#5687 category: the
#   #4501 per-model ceiling ("You've reached your Fable 5 limit. Run
#   /usage-credits to continue …") mentions credits too, and matching the new
#   branch first would have re-classified it. SESSION_LIMIT must precede
#   TOKEN_EXHAUSTED
#   because "concurrent session limit" contains the substring "session limit"
#   that the exhaustion regex also matches (#3947) — and, since #4501 widened
#   the exhaustion regex to "reached your <model> limit", it now also contains
#   the "reached your … limit" shape, making that ordering load-bearing for a
#   second reason. MODEL_REFUSAL is matched
#   only when exit_code != 0, preserving the #3233 exit-code-first guarantee
#   (a clean exit whose output merely mentions "refusal" stays SUCCESS).
#
#   Generic transients — rate-limit/429, 5xx, network errors, and the
#   catch-all RECOVERABLE — are provider-INDEPENDENT and apply to every
#   provider, including unknown ones. An unknown provider never produces an
#   error; it always resolves through the generic table.
#
# Design — exit-code-first ordering (issue #3233, preserved by the split
# above):
#   The original lean-genius implementation grepped output BEFORE checking
#   the exit code, which caused false positives on clean exits whose stdout
#   legitimately contained substrings like "500" or "rate limit" (issue
#   #3233). This rewrite checks the exit code first and only inspects output
#   for genuine failures (exit_code != 0). This ordering lives in the shared
#   engine and applies identically regardless of provider.
#
# Design source: this provider-table split is a re-implementation, not a
# cherry-pick, of the engine/table split pioneered in gpeyton/loom@fd5d1da8
# ("feat(errors): per-provider pattern tables in classify-error.sh"). That
# commit predates upstream's SESSION_LIMIT (#3947) and MODEL_REFUSAL
# categories, so it is used here only as a design reference for the
# selector/table shape — all six Claude-specific categories, in their
# current documented order, are carried into the `claude` table below.
#
# Test vectors: the `claude` table's live in
# `defaults/scripts/tests/test-spawn-claude.sh`; the `codex` table's (plus the
# cross-provider isolation checks that prove the claude vectors are unchanged)
# live in `defaults/scripts/tests/test-spawn-codex.sh`.

# shellcheck disable=SC2120  # OK that callers pass the args; we don't default.

    # RECOVERABLE catch-all — the wrapper retried the same dead credential
    # with backoff until MAX_RETRIES, then died with classification=RECOVERABLE
    # instead of TOKEN_EXPIRED, and the account was never marked bad. The next
    # spawn could select the SAME auth-dead account again with no memory of
    # the failure — this is the mechanism behind the issue's "most died within

    # Issue #6424: two more account-level death phrasings hit the same gap.
    # "Your organization has disabled Claude subscription access for Claude
    # Code" (a billing/authorization fault, resolved by the operator) and
    # "Failed to authenticate. API Error: 403 The socket connection was closed
    # unexpectedly" (observed as the sibling death-tail on the same incident)
    # both matched none of the patterns above and fell through to the generic
    # RECOVERABLE catch-all — measured on one host's logs, 37 of 43 permanent
    # deaths carried the first phrase and the remaining 6 carried the second.
    # Folded into TOKEN_EXPIRED rather than a new distinct category: the
    # remedy is identical in kind (mark this account bad, rotate, needs human
    # re-authorization, never blind-retried), and `claude-wrapper.sh`'s
    # `is_account_auth_dead()` already dispatches on exactly this
    # classification, so no daemon-side enum change is required. Only the
    # substring "organization has disabled" is matched (not the full sentence)
    # so minor wording drift in the CLI's own phrasing still classifies. The
    # socket-closed phrase is deliberately anchored to "failed to
    # authenticate ... socket connection was closed unexpectedly" (not a bare
    # "socket connection was closed") so an unrelated transient network drop
    # mid-session — which legitimately belongs in the generic RECOVERABLE
    # table — is not swept into this terminal, account-marked-bad branch.
    # Issue #6614: a token REVOKED mid-flight (an operator running `/login` on
    # the host invalidates the pooled OAuth credential the fleet is riding on)
    # produced a third variant this pattern missed, verbatim:
    #   Failed to authenticate. API Error: 401 {"type":"authentication_error",
    #   "message":"OAuth access token has been revoked."}
    # Two independent gaps let it through:
    #   * `401[^a-z]*authentication_error` cannot bridge the JSON envelope. The
    #     `[^a-z]*` gap between "401" and "authentication_error" excludes
    #     LETTERS, and the real payload puts `{"type":"` (and, in the nested
    #     `{"type":"error","error":{...}}` form the API also serves, the word
    #     "error" too) in between — so the alternation dies before it reaches
    #     "authentication_error".
    #   * Neither "revoked" nor "access token" appeared anywhere in this file.
    # So the death fell through to the generic RECOVERABLE catch-all and
    # `claude-wrapper.sh` retried the SAME revoked credential MAX_RETRIES (5)
    # times before dying — a revoked token cannot recover, so every one of
    # those retries was pure latency plus a duplicated 401 in the logs.
    #
    # Both gaps are closed with anchored phrases rather than a blanket
    # `401.*authentication_error`: marking an account bad carries reason `auth`
    # (persists until a manual `loom-daemon tokens unblock`), so the
    # false-positive direction is the expensive one, and a bare `.*` would let
    # any non-zero-exit output that merely MENTIONS both tokens on one line
    # (an agent quoting this very incident, say) condemn a healthy account.
    #   * `"type":"authentication_error"` — the JSON field itself, whitespace-
    #     tolerant. Unambiguous, and matches the nested envelope too, which no
    #     "401-then-gap" pattern can.
    #   * `token (has been|was) revoked` — requires the word "token" directly
    #     before the revocation verb, so an unrelated "revoked" (a revoked
    #     approval, a revoked branch ruleset) cannot fire it. Covers "OAuth
    #     access token has been revoked" as a substring, so no separate
    #     "access token" alternation is needed.
    # Kept in TOKEN_EXPIRED (not a new category) for the #6424 reason: the
    # remedy is identical in kind — mark this account bad, rotate, never

    #     clears it. On a single-account host — and on the in-session Task
    #     dispatch path, which has no account pool at all — that is the ONLY
    #     remedy; "rotate the account" is not applicable there.
    #   * The consumer that needs it is not this classifier's caller. The
    #     `/loom:sweep` orchestrator dispatches wave builders via the Task
    #     tool, so no subprocess exists for this file to classify; it reads
    #     the failure text itself and needs a named signature to key its
    #     one-rung-down model fallback on (sweep.md, "Credit-exhaustion
    #     fallback"). Folding the phrase into TOKEN_EXHAUSTED would have made
    #     that signature unnameable.
    # Behaviourally it is a SYNONYM of TOKEN_EXHAUSTED for every account-pool
    # consumer: `claude-wrapper.sh::is_account_exhaustion` accepts it (rotate +
    # mark bad), `classification_is_transient` retries it, and
    # `tokens_pool::health` gives it the identical PlanExhausted cooldown. So
    # the daemon/wrapper path behaves as it would have under TOKEN_EXHAUSTED —
    # only the reported name (and therefore the telemetry + the orchestrator's
    # remedy choice) is finer-grained.

# Only called when exit_code != 0.
#
# Provider table for the OpenAI Codex CLI adapter (`spawn-codex.sh`, epic #4167
# Phase 2 / issue #4468). Ported from the gpeyton/loom fork's codex table by
# Graham Peyton, then re-grounded against the real CLI: every phrase below was
# either OBSERVED in `codex exec` output on codex-cli 0.146.0 (2026-07-29) or
# extracted verbatim from that binary's own message strings. Nothing here is
# guessed — where a category has no defensible Codex signature it is left
# unimplemented and documented as such rather than filled with Claude wording.
#
# Match order and why:
#   1. FATAL config faults    unambiguous, and they must not be retried.
#   2. TOKEN_EXHAUSTED        BEFORE TOKEN_EXPIRED: OpenAI has served
#                             `insufficient_quota` with a 401 status as well as
#                             429, and mis-classifying a quota fault as an auth
#                             fault is the expensive direction — TOKEN_EXPIRED
#                             marks an account bad with reason `auth` (persists
#                             until a manual `loom-daemon tokens unblock`), whereas
#                             TOKEN_EXHAUSTED uses reason `exhausted` (TTL-
#                             expires on its own). Quota wording is also the
#                             more specific signal, so letting it win is both
#                             safer and more precise.
#   3. TOKEN_EXPIRED          401 / not-signed-in / refresh-token failures.
#
# Deliberately NOT implemented for codex (documented, not forgotten):
#   CWD_DELETED    No Codex-specific signature for "the workspace vanished
#                  mid-run" is known. Claude's "current working directory was
#                  deleted" phrasing is Claude-CLI-specific and is NOT reused.
#   SESSION_LIMIT  Codex exposes no concurrent-session-cap error wording. A
#                  bare 429 stays RECOVERABLE via the generic table, which is
#                  the correct conservative behavior (retry, don't mark bad).
#   MODEL_REFUSAL  The Responses API can emit a refusal content part, but the
#                  Codex CLI has no stable surfaced wording for it, and a
#                  refusal does not reliably produce a non-zero exit.
#
# Sandbox denials are deliberately absent — and that is a FINDING, not an
# omission. A Codex sandbox denial is an in-session tool failure, not a process
# failure: verified on 0.146.0 with `-s read-only`, a blocked `touch` returns
# `Operation not permitted` to the model and the `codex exec` process still
# exits **0**. Exit-code-first classification therefore never reaches this
# table for a denial, and adding an "Operation not permitted" pattern here
# would be dead code that could only ever fire as a false positive on some
# unrelated non-zero exit. What IS classified below is a sandbox/trust fault
# that genuinely aborts the run: the trusted-directory refusal, and Codex
# failing to construct its sandbox at all. See
# `defaults/docs/guardrail-parity-codex.md` for the full trust-boundary map.

# classification_is_transient <category> -> exit 0 when a caller's retry loop
# SHOULD retry the same invocation, 1 when the failure is terminal for that
# caller. The argument is a category emitted by `classify_error`.
#
# Why this lives here. Before #4501, `claude-wrapper.sh::is_transient_error`
# kept its OWN pattern array, disjoint from this file's tables, so the retry
# decision and the printed `classification=` were two independent verdict
# systems that could — and did — contradict each other in the same log block:
#
#   [ERROR] Non-transient error detected - not retrying
#   [ERROR] exit_code=1 classification=RECOVERABLE
#
# Deriving the verdict from the category makes that contradiction structurally
# impossible: there is now exactly one classifier, and the retry decision is a
# pure function of its output.
#
# Policy is a DENY-LIST. Only categories whose fault cannot be cleared by
# retrying the same invocation are terminal; everything else — including the
# generic RECOVERABLE catch-all for an *unrecognized* non-zero exit — is
# retried, bounded by the caller's own retry cap. Retry-by-default is the
# fail-safe direction for unattended daemon children: an allow-list of known
# transient phrasings has twice turned a new CLI wording into an instant
# permanent death (#4255's bare `Execution error`, #4501's "reached your
# <model> limit"), while an over-retry costs only a bounded backoff. It also
# matches the documented contract of the catch-all in

# daemon mode").

# `classify_error` / `classification_is_transient`, above -- deliberately did
# NOT move, for the reason in #4501: it is the fleet's single source of truth
# for what a failure IS, and a second copy of it in Rust could disagree with
# this one. Shell still says what the failure is; the daemon owns what the
# wrapper does about it.
