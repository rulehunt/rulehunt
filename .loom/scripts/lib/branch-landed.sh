# branch-landed.sh — the ONE "has this branch landed on the default branch?"
# primitive (#7812).
#
# Five separate defects (#5189, #5665, #4918, #4889, #5657) were all the same
# question answered four different ways:
#
#   loom-daemon clean --aggressive : `is_ancestor_of_origin_main` (raw reachability)
#   worktree.sh remove             : `git branch -d`
#   worktree.sh N                  : reuse origin/feature/issue-N if it exists
#   merge-pr.sh                    : tip-matches-merged-PR-head, then `git branch -D`
#
# Every reachability-based answer is WRONG under squash merging (the squash
# commit is a brand-new commit with no parent link to the branch) and equally
# wrong under GitHub's rebase merge, which "always updates the committer
# information and creates new commit SHAs". Each site was patched separately,
# so the repo carried four private squash-awareness implementations that would
# each need re-patching for the next merge strategy. This file replaces them.
#
# Source this file (do not exec). Defines one public function:
#
#   branch_landed <branch> [<default-branch>] [<known-merged-head-sha>]
#
# It PRINTS exactly one of:
#
#   landed      — the default branch already contains everything this branch has
#   not-landed  — the branch carries content the default branch does not have
#   unknown     — could not be determined (forge unreachable AND the local
#                 tree comparison unavailable)
#
# and ALWAYS returns 0 — a non-zero return would abort a `set -e` caller that
# invokes it as a plain statement, and "not landed" is an answer, not an error.
#
# `unknown` MUST fail closed at every call site: never reap, never delete,
# never skip a branch on it. That is the whole point of a three-way answer —
# coercing it to `landed` loses work, and coercing it to `not-landed`
# resurrects the pre-#4889 "can never clean up a squash-merged branch" bug.
#
# # Answer ladder (first definitive answer wins)
#
#   1. ANCESTRY — `git merge-base --is-ancestor <branch> <default>`. Only ever
#      proves `landed` (true under a merge-commit strategy or a fast-forward);
#      its falsity proves nothing, which is exactly the trap the four private
#      heuristics fell into. Cheap, offline, works on every git version.
#   2. CALLER HINT — an already-known merged-PR head SHA (`merge-pr.sh` has
#      just merged the PR and holds `$PR_HEAD_SHA`). Matching tip ⇒ `landed`
#      with zero forge calls; a mismatch skips the forge probe (we already
#      know what the forge would say) and falls through to the tree check.
#   3. FORGE — a MERGED pull request whose head branch is <branch>. Matching
#      head SHA ⇒ `landed`. This is the squash/rebase-proof answer, and the
#      only one available when the local tree comparison cannot run.
#   4. TREE EQUALITY — `git merge-tree --write-tree <default> <branch>` and
#      compare the resulting tree OID with `<default>^{tree}`. Equal trees mean
#      merging the branch would change nothing, i.e. the default branch already
#      contains every change the branch carries — true for a squash, a rebase
#      merge, or a merge commit, and completely independent of SHAs. Requires
#      git >= 2.38; no working tree is mutated, so it is safe against a bare
#      mirror or a linked worktree.
#
# Note the tree comparison is against the default branch's CURRENT tip, not its
# tip at merge time. That degrades gracefully: as the default branch moves
# further ahead, a landed branch stays landed (tree equality really says
# "already contains everything this branch has"), which strengthens over time
# unless something on the default branch reverts the change.
#
# On git < 2.38 step 4 is unavailable. There is deliberately NO rebase-based
# substitute: `git diff --quiet <default>...<branch>` compares against the
# merge base, which is non-empty for exactly the squash/rebase cases that
# matter, so it would confidently report `not-landed` for a landed branch —
# worse than admitting `unknown`. Instead the forge answer stands alone there,
# and a forge-unavailable probe resolves to `unknown` (fail closed).
#
# # Side-channel globals
#
# `branch_landed` also sets these globals for callers that need more than the
# verdict (messages naming the PR, distinguishing "forge said no" from "forge
# was down"). They are only observable when it is called as a PLAIN STATEMENT —
# `$(branch_landed ...)` runs in a subshell and discards them:
#
#   BRANCH_LANDED_VERDICT      — same string as stdout
#   BRANCH_LANDED_EVIDENCE     — which rung answered: ancestor | merged-head-match |
#                                forge-merged-pr | tree-equal | tree-differs |
#                                tree-conflict | forge-no-merged-pr |
#                                merged-head-mismatch | inconclusive
#   BRANCH_LANDED_PR_NUMBER    — merged PR number when the forge answered
#   BRANCH_LANDED_PR_HEAD_SHA  — that PR's head SHA
#   BRANCH_LANDED_FORGE_STATUS — found | not_found | unavailable | hinted | skipped
#
# `unavailable` is the one every caller must special-case: it is "the safety
# check could not even be attempted", not "checked, and it is unmerged".
#
# # Test seams
#
#   LOOM_BRANCH_LANDED_OFFLINE=1        — skip the forge probe entirely.
#   LOOM_BRANCH_LANDED_GIT_VERSION=x.y  — override the detected git version
#                                         (simulates a pre-2.38 host).
