# worktree-removal-log.sh — the bash half of the worktree-removal ledger (#5950)
#
# Loom deletes worktrees from eight independent code paths (`loom-daemon
# clean`, `clean --aggressive`, the daemon's periodic reaper, the daemon's
# terminal-destroy path, `loom-recover-orphans`, `merge-pr.sh`'s post-merge
# cleanup, `worktree.sh remove`, `agent-destroy.sh`), each reporting to its own
# sink. When a Builder's live worktree vanished mid-session (#5950, during
# issue #5919) there was no single place to look for "what removed it?".
#
# Every Loom-owned removal now appends one JSON line to
# `<repo_root>/.loom/logs/worktree-removals.log`. That makes the answer
# symmetric: an entry names the mechanism, and NO entry is itself evidence that
# no Loom path did it (so the search moves to host-level/manual removal).
#
# The line format is byte-identical to the Rust writer
# (`loom-daemon/src/worktree_ops/removal_log.rs`) so one grep/jq reads both.
#
# Usage:
#   source "$SCRIPT_DIR/lib/worktree-removal-log.sh"
#   loom_record_worktree_removal <repo_root> <mechanism> <worktree_path> [branch] [reason]
#
# Strictly best-effort: never fails, never writes to stdout/stderr, and always
# returns 0 — a ledger problem must never break a removal or a caller's `set -e`.

# Guard against double-sourcing.
