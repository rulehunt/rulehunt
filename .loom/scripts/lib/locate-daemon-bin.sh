# locate-daemon-bin.sh — Resolve the loom-daemon binary to invoke.
#
# Source this file (do not exec). Defines the two resolution pairs below —
# and the split between the first pair and the second pair is the point
# (#8134) — plus the capability/version questions about whatever they resolved
# (loom_daemon_model_select_flag, #8058; loom_daemon_version_preflight /
# loom_daemon_exec_checked, #8385):
#
#   $LOOM_DAEMON_BIN      the daemon a caller MANAGES or PROBES — the install
#                         whose version is compared, the socket endpoint a
#                         watchdog round-trips, a deliberately fake binary in a
#                         test. Resolved by loom_locate_daemon_bin below.
#   $LOOM_DAEMON_SELF_BIN the daemon that IMPLEMENTS the caller's own logic —
#                         what a Shape-A stub execs its subcommand on.
#                         Resolved by loom_daemon_self_bin_override /
#                         loom_resolve_self_daemon_bin further down.
#
# One variable cannot mean both: a suite that pins $LOOM_DAEMON_BIN to a probe
# mock would otherwise also redirect the stub into that mock (the #8134 hang).
# Which one a new caller wants is a question about the caller, not about the
# repo: "is this the binary I run, or the binary I inspect?"
#
#   loom_locate_daemon_bin <repo_root> -> echoes the absolute path to a
#   loom-daemon binary on stdout, or an empty string if none could be
#   resolved.
#
#   loom_daemon_bin_search_paths <repo_root> -> echoes the ordered list of
#   locations that WOULD be checked (one per line, in precedence order),
#   for use in "binary not found" error text. Does not write to the
#   filesystem -- it just renders the same candidate list
#   loom_locate_daemon_bin walks (which, since #6208, can include a
#   read-only `cargo metadata` call -- see _loom_daemon_repo_candidates()).
#
# Resolution precedence (first match wins):
#   1. $LOOM_DAEMON_BIN — must be executable.
#   2. Only when $LOOM_PREFER_REPO_BUILD=1: the build-output-relative
#      candidates under <repo_root> (see step 4 below), hoisted above the
#      installed binary so a developer who just `cargo build`ed in a
#      checkout runs what they built instead of a stale
#      $HOME/.local/bin/loom-daemon (#4997). Off by default — the plain
#      `loom-daemon-start.sh` / `.loom/bin/loom` production path must keep
#      preferring the machine-level install unconditionally.
#   3. `loom-daemon` on PATH.
#   4. The machine-level install location: $LOOM_DAEMON_BIN_DIR (default
#      $HOME/.local/bin) — this is where loom-daemon-update.sh's --provision
#      path installs, and the location `ssh host 'cmd'` (a non-interactive
#      shell that never sources the login profile, so $HOME/.local/bin is
#      NOT on PATH) needs an explicit check for (#4875).
#   5. Build-output-relative candidates under <repo_root>, honoring a
#      redirected $CARGO_TARGET_DIR / build.target-dir (#6208):
#        $CARGO_TARGET_DIR/release/loom-daemon (if $CARGO_TARGET_DIR is set)
#        $CARGO_TARGET_DIR/debug/loom-daemon   (if $CARGO_TARGET_DIR is set)
#        loom-daemon/target/release/loom-daemon
#        loom-daemon/target/debug/loom-daemon
#        target/release/loom-daemon
#        target/debug/loom-daemon
#        <cargo metadata's target_directory>/release/loom-daemon (fallback)
#        <cargo metadata's target_directory>/debug/loom-daemon   (fallback)
#
# Extracted (issue #4080) from the identical inline copies in
# loom-daemon-start.sh and loom-daemon-update.sh so probe-tokens.sh's
# daemon-binary resolution does not add a fourth copy of this logic. #4875
# added the machine-level install fallback (step 4) plus
# loom_daemon_bin_search_paths(), and migrated the remaining inline copies in
# loom-daemon-start.sh / loom-daemon-watchdog.sh / loom-daemon-update.sh /
# loom-status.sh / .loom/bin/loom onto this single shared definition so a
# future new candidate path never has to be ported by hand across six copies
# again. #4997 added the diagnostic stderr line (every resolution names the
# path + provenance + mtime it landed on, so "which binary ran" is always
# answerable from a sweep/session log) and the opt-in $LOOM_PREFER_REPO_BUILD
# precedence hoist (step 2). #6208 taught the repo-local candidates (steps 2
# and 5) to also honor a redirected $CARGO_TARGET_DIR / ~/.cargo/config.toml's
# build.target-dir (resolved via `cargo metadata`, mirroring the build-time
# fix for loom-daemon-update.sh in #6160/#6209) instead of only ever probing
# the four historical hardcoded paths -- see _loom_daemon_repo_candidates().
#
# $LOOM_LOCATE_DAEMON_BIN_QUIET=1 suppresses the #4997 resolution-trace line
# above for a single call (default unset, i.e. the trace still prints — this
# is opt-in per-caller, not a global behavior change). Added for #6392: a
# caller that execs straight into the resolved binary (e.g.
# recover-orphaned-shepherds.sh) and inherits its stderr can otherwise leave
# this *success* trace as the only line an operator ever sees on a
# subsequent non-zero exit — read at a glance it looks like a failure
# reason, but it always reports a successful resolution. Set this only when
# the resolved binary's own stderr is the more useful signal; leave it unset
# anywhere "which binary ran" is itself the diagnostic (the common case).

# Best-effort mtime, formatted for a human-readable log line. GNU `stat -c`
# first (illegal option on BSD/macOS, so it fails cleanly there), then BSD
# `stat -f`. Echoes "unknown" if neither works (e.g. the path vanished
# between resolution and logging) rather than failing the caller.

# loom_resolve_self_daemon_bin -- the loom-daemon that IMPLEMENTS a caller's

#
# The distinction is the whole point and it is easy to get wrong (#7977 caught
# it in a test fixture): loom_locate_daemon_bin / $LOOM_DAEMON_BIN name the
# INSTALLED daemon a script MANAGES -- the one whose version is compared, which
# may be an old release with no `retry-classify` / `release-resolve`
# subcommand at all, and which during a test is a deliberately fake binary.
# Exec'ing a ported subcommand on that is a category error.
#
# Resolution order, most explicit first:
#   1. $LOOM_DAEMON_SELF_BIN -- must be executable. The seam a test or an
#      operator uses to name the implementation directly.
#   2. A build in THIS checkout ($CARGO_TARGET_DIR honored, release then debug).
#      Script-relative first: this library lives at <checkout>/defaults/scripts/lib/
#      (or <consumer>/.loom/scripts/lib/), so the build that implements the
#      logic THIS COPY delegates to is the one in the checkout this copy came
#      from -- not whatever $REPO_ROOT happens to be (in a test fixture,
#      $REPO_ROOT is the fixture, which has no build at all). $REPO_ROOT is
#      still probed after it, for the caller that has one.
#   3. `loom-daemon` on PATH.
#   4. The machine-level install location: $LOOM_DAEMON_BIN_DIR (default
#      $HOME/.local/bin) -- the same directory loom-daemon-update.sh's
#      --provision path writes to, and the same tier loom_locate_daemon_bin
#      already carries for the `ssh host 'cmd'` case (#4875) where a
#      non-interactive shell never puts it on PATH. Added by #8712: with only
#      tiers 1-3, a host whose repo-local build was unusable AND whose PATH did
#      not carry loom-daemon resolved NOTHING, even though the install this
#      very script updates was sitting right there.
# Echoes "" when none resolves; the caller then answers in its own contract
# (a fail-safe verdict, not a crash) rather than failing silently.
#
# Lives here, beside loom_locate_daemon_bin, so the two resolutions sit next to
# each other and the distinction above is unmissable. Extracted from
# cli/loom-daemon-update.sh by #8037, when claude-wrapper.sh became the second

#
# THE INCIDENT (#8712). A test fixture's 472-byte bash fake -- the
# `fake loom-daemon: unsupported subcommand: $*` stub daemon-update-fixtures.sh
# writes -- was left at `loom-daemon/target/release/loom-daemon` in a fleet
# host's checkout. `loom-daemon-update.sh --fetch` delegates the download to
# `"$rf_bin" release-fetch`, tier 2 handed it that file, and every auto_update
# fetch on the host failed for hours (attempts 1-5, backoff to 960s) while the
# machine-level install this script exists to UPDATE sat one tier below,
# perfectly fine. Moving the fake aside made the same command succeed at once.
#
# So tier 2 is the one tier that is INFERRED rather than named: nobody asserted
# that file is a loom-daemon; it was found by path convention, and build-output
# paths accumulate stale, half-written and (as above) outright fake files. One
# `--version` call -- microseconds against a real binary, already the idiom
# `_loom_daemon_reported_version` uses below -- converts an unrecoverable
# update loop into a fallback.
#
# DELIBERATELY NOT APPLIED TO TIERS 1, 3 AND 4. Tier 1 ($LOOM_DAEMON_SELF_BIN)
# is an EXPLICIT pin: an operator or a test naming a binary directly is stating
# the answer, and second-guessing it would break every suite that pins a
# deliberately-fake implementation (and would remove the escape hatch that
# selects a repo-local build explicitly). Tiers 3/4 are the fallback itself --
# there is nothing below them to fall through TO, so a probe there could only
# convert "hand back the install and let it report its own error" into "hand
# back nothing", which is strictly less actionable.
#

#
# A stub whose only statement is `exec "$bin" <sub>` has no version guard at
# all: against a binary that predates its subcommand, clap's own
#
#     error: unrecognized subcommand 'skip-labels'
#
# is the entire signal -- it names neither the version to roll to nor the
# command to roll with. That is exactly what happened to `skip-labels.sh` on
# 2026-09-19 against this repo's own installed 0.19.179. #8285 gave merge-pr.sh
# an actionable refusal for the same class; the functions below are the shared
# version, for `loom_exec_script_helper` and for any stub that execs a
# subcommand on a binary this file just resolved.
#
# WHY HERE and not in lib/script-helper.sh. This answers a question about the
# RESOLVED BINARY -- "is the thing I just found new enough to serve this call?"
# -- which is the same question `loom_daemon_model_select_flag` above already
# answers for `tokens select --model` (#8058), and it sits one line downstream
# of the resolution it depends on. It is also `bootstrap` work by definition:
# the binary being diagnosed is precisely the one too old to host the check as
# a subcommand, the same circularity `check-daemon-subcommand-versions.sh`
# argues for itself in scripts/shell-allowlist.txt. Putting it in the
# `contract` helper instead would have added portable shell that epic #7810 is
# retiring, to do a job that can never leave shell.
#
# OPT-IN BY DECLARATION, not by flag. The preflight fires only when the CALLING
# stub carries a `# requires-daemon: <this subcommand> >= <version>` marker --
# the same marker `scripts/check-daemon-subcommand-versions.sh` already
# enforces and `merge-pr.sh` already reads back at refusal time. A stub that
# declares nothing, declares `optional` (it probes and degrades), or declares a
# floor for a DIFFERENT subcommand is byte-identically unaffected, so this can
# be adopted one file at a time across the eleven-stub family. The marker is
# read out of the caller's own source, so the floor in the message, the floor
# the CI gate checks, and the floor a reviewer sees are one string.
#
# FAILS OPEN, deliberately -- the opposite of merge-pr.sh's guards, for a
# reason worth stating. Those guards fail CLOSED because an empty answer there
# is indistinguishable from a real one and would silently close an unfinished
# issue. This is not a safety gate: its only job is to turn an unactionable
# error into an actionable one. So when the floor cannot be read, `--version`
# cannot be parsed, or the subcommand name is not marker-shaped, it does
# NOTHING and the exec proceeds -- reproducing today's behaviour exactly, with
# the subcommand itself still refusing correctly when it is genuinely absent.
# Refusing on an unreadable version would invent a brand-new failure mode on a
# host whose binary is probably fine, which is a strictly worse trade.
#
