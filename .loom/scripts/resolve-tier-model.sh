# resolve-tier-model.sh - Print the model an issue's work must run on (#4238).
#
# Turns the Curator's runtime-neutral complexity tier into a concrete model id,
# so the dispatch path does a LOOKUP instead of a judgement call. Reading a
# document and "resolving" a model in your head is how model selection silently
# drifts; this makes the resolution a command whose output is either used or
# visibly absent.
#
#   resolve-tier-model.sh <issue> [runtime] [repo]   # runtime defaults to claude
#
# Resolution:
#   1. Read `<!-- loom:complexity=... -->` from the issue body. Missing or
#      unrecognised => routine (the safe middle).
#   2. Look up sweep.tierModels[<runtime>][<tier>] in .loom/config.json. If that
#      has no entry, fall back to the tier's entry (if any) in the
#      sweep.optimization preset (`cost` | `speed` | `balanced`, default
#      `balanced`; env override LOOM_SWEEP_OPTIMIZATION, issue #4238 Phase B).
#      Either way the resolved logical tier is passed through resolve-model.sh
#      (logical tier -> current-generation ID). All three steps live in
#      loom-daemon/src/script_helpers/model_tiers.rs (--tier mode), so they are
#      covered by its Rust unit tests rather than duplicated here in inline
#      python.
#   3. No entry from either source (or a mapping that would resolve to `fable`)
#      => print nothing, exit 3, so the caller falls through to its normal
#      precedence chain (the tier-3 role default) instead of guessing a model.
#      An unconfigured repo (or one with sweep.optimization unset/"balanced")
#      therefore dispatches byte-identically to today.
#
# Prints ONLY the model id on stdout; diagnostics go to stderr.
#
# Side effect (#8543, load-gated on TYPESAFE_API_KEY, off by default): the
# `resolve-model.sh --tier` call at the bottom of this script carries
# `LOOM_JEV_SHADOW_ISSUE` (below), which lets its native backend fire a
# shadow-mode Jev (TypeSafe) classification of the SAME issue and record it on
# that issue's sweep checkpoint, for later comparison against the Curator's
# `$tier`. All of it lives in `loom-daemon` (`jev_tier.rs`'s module doc, and
# `shadow_sample_from_env` for why an env var rather than a flag): telemetry
# only, never a routing input, and structurally unable to change this script's
# `$tier`/`$model` resolution or exit code.

# Source forge-helpers.sh UNCONDITIONALLY (#446): both repo resolution below

# `GH_CONFIG_DIR` recovers via `forge_gh_repo_safe`'s escalation ladder (or
# fails with an accurate diagnosis) instead of the bare `gh` calls this script
# used before -- which simply 404/GraphQL-failed straight through to the
# tier-3 default with a misleading "likely API quota" message. That was
# exactly this script's own contribution to the 2026-08-21 incident: it
# doesn't source this file at all in the < #446 version, so it had no path to

# $(... | grep ... )` pipeline below relies on `grep` returning non-zero (no
# marker found) as an ORDINARY, handled case that feeds the `case "") tier=
# routine` fallback a few lines down, not a fatal error. This script's own

# Fetch the issue body with a GraphQL->REST fallback (#4472). `gh issue view` is
# a GraphQL call; under quota exhaustion (routine at fleet scale, epic #4432) it
# fails and a swallowed failure parses as an empty tier -> `routine`, silently
# disabling cost/speed routing. REST draws on a separate quota, so try it before
# giving up. If BOTH fail we still fall through to `routine` (a non-breaking
# default for this non-blocking resolver — unlike require-complexity-marker.sh
# this script never blocks curation) but say so, so the degradation shows in logs.
#
# Each attempt is routed through `forge_gh_repo_safe` (#446) when available, so
# a wrong-repo `GH_CONFIG_DIR` signature gets one more chance to recover (the
# owner-partitioned credential directory, or `env -u GH_CONFIG_DIR`) before
# this resolver gives up -- and the final diagnostic distinguishes "recovery
# was attempted and still failed on a wrong-repo signature" from the generic
# "likely API quota" guess, rather than conflating the two. Falls back to the
# bare `gh` calls this script used before #446 if forge-helpers.sh could not
# be sourced (the guarded `source ... || true` above never hard-fails this
