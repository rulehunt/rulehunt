#!/usr/bin/env bash
# check-ingest-key-file.sh — validate that observability.ingestKeyFile
# resolves to a readable, non-foreign-home path on THIS host (issue #5336).
#
# Root cause this guards against: on 2026-08-04, a `loom-worker-2` (Linux,
# home `/home/ubuntu`) daemon reported observability as `disabled` because
# its resolved `ingestKeyFile` was `/Users/alice/.loom/observability/ingest.key`
# — a macOS path committed verbatim into the shared `.loom/config.json`,
# copied unmodified onto every host that pulled `main`. The real key file was
# sitting at `/home/ubuntu/.loom/observability/ingest.key` the whole time.
#
# This script re-derives the SAME resolution the daemon itself performs
# (env > config > $HOME-relative default — see
# `loom-daemon/src/observability/mod.rs::resolve_ingest_key_file`), then
# checks the result for exactly that defect class plus basic readability.
#
# Usage:
#   ./defaults/scripts/check-ingest-key-file.sh [repo_root]
#
#   repo_root defaults to the nearest ancestor of $PWD containing a `.loom/`
#   directory (falls back to $PWD when none is found — matching every other
#   config-resolver.sh caller's soft-fail-to-`{}` contract for a repo with no
#   config at all).
#
# Resolution precedence (highest first), mirroring the daemon exactly:
#   1. $LOOM_OBSERVABILITY_INGEST_KEY_FILE
#   2. observability.ingestKeyFile from the tiered config
#      (defaults/scripts/lib/config-resolver.sh: .loom-local/local.json >
#      .loom-project/project.json > .loom/config.json > private defaults)
#   3. $HOME/.loom/observability/ingest.key (the daemon's built-in default)
#
# Checks, in order:
#   a. Foreign-home path — the resolved path is an absolute path under
#      /Users/<x>, /home/<x>, or /root that names a DIFFERENT home directory
#      than this host's own $HOME. This is the exact #5336 defect class: a
#      value copied verbatim from a different host.
#   b. Readable — the resolved path names a file this process can read (the
#      minimum bar for the daemon, which runs as the same account in every
#      deployment this repo documents, to read it too).
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 - resolved path is readable and is not a foreign-home path (PASS)
#   1 - foreign-home path detected (FAIL)
#   2 - resolved path is not a readable file — missing, a directory, or
#       permission-denied (FAIL)
#
# This single script serves two roles in dashboard/docs/deploy-runbook.md:
#   - step 9c's provisioning-time readability gate (run right after writing a
#     host's key, before declaring that step done), and
#   - the fleet-wide regression check (run unmodified on every fleet host to
#     confirm none of them carries a foreign-home path — issue #5336's own
#     "fleet-wide check" acceptance criterion).
#
# Never a network call, never touches the key's contents (only whether the
# path is readable) — safe to run on a live host at any time.
