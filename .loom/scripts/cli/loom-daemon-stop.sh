#!/usr/bin/env bash
# loom-daemon-stop.sh - Clean shutdown for the RAW loom-daemon process
# (autonomous work-finder + main-health-gate host — epic #3809, Phase D #3813).
#
# This is NOT the tmux agent pool. `.loom/bin/loom stop` (loom-stop.sh) tears
# down the Manual-Orchestration-Mode tmux pool; THIS script stops the
# `loom-daemon` binary started by loom-daemon-start.sh.
#
# Shutdown model (drain vs. survive):
#   The daemon handles BOTH SIGINT (Ctrl-C) and SIGTERM (`kill <pid>`) by
#   removing its Unix socket and exiting cleanly (#3813). This script sends
#   SIGTERM, waits a grace window, then escalates to SIGKILL if needed.
#
#   In-flight `/loom:sweep` children are NOT cancelled. They are independent
#   detached processes that survive a daemon restart BY DESIGN — stopping the
#   dispatcher must not kill dispatched work. This "survive, don't drain"
#   decision means you can stop+start the daemon without losing running builds;
#   the reaper reconciles their state on the next start. To actively cancel a
#   sweep, use `mcp__loom__cancel_sweep` against a running daemon before stopping.
#
#   Scheduled ROLE agents (Champion/Curator/Judge/Doctor/Guide/…) survive this
#   stop for the same reason, and on a Linux `systemd --user` host they can
#   ALSO be architecturally detached from this daemon's own process tree — a
#   transient `systemd-run --user --scope` (issue #5111's CPU-quota mechanism)
#   parents them to the user manager, not to `loom-daemon`, so they keep
#   running and drawing on the token pool even after this script reports
#   success (issue #6129). This script's stop is intentionally NOT a fleet
#   quiesce. An operator who actually wants to stop dispatch AND every
#   in-flight role/sweep child — draining a host for maintenance or an
#   exhausted token pool — should run `loom-daemon-quiesce.sh` instead, which
#   does both, the same way on launchd and systemd.
#
# Linux systemd --user counterpart (#4268): when loom-daemon-start.sh installed
# the daemon as a `systemd --user` service, this script detects that ownership
# (`systemctl --user is-active`/`is-enabled <unit>`) and stops + DISABLES the unit
# (`systemctl --user disable --now <unit>`) instead of a raw pid kill — the systemd
# analog of the launchd bootout below. Disabling is what keeps a subsequent reboot
# from resurrecting the daemon (the unit sets [Install] WantedBy=default.target).
# The escape hatch LOOM_DAEMON_SYSTEMD=0 disables ALL systemd interaction
# symmetrically with loom-daemon-start.sh --no-systemd (#4078 analog), falling back
# to the pid-file/nohup tier.
#
# macOS launchd counterpart (#3972): when loom-daemon-start.sh loaded the
# daemon as a launchd LaunchAgent (in the resolve_launchd_domain() domain —
# gui/<uid> or user/<uid>, #4130), this script ALSO unloads the launchd
# job definition (`launchctl bootout`) after the process is confirmed dead —
# not just kills the pid. This matters because the generated plist sets
# RunAtLoad=true (mirroring the validated incident-fix plist), so leaving the
# definition loaded would silently relaunch the daemon at the next login/boot
# even though the operator explicitly stopped it. The pid-kill sequence itself
# is unchanged (SIGTERM -> grace -> SIGKILL, sent directly to the resolved pid).
#
# Interaction with the supervised restart primitive (#4054): the plist now uses
# KeepAlive:{SuccessfulExit:true}, so launchd relaunches the daemon on a clean
# exit 0. But the daemon exits NON-ZERO on SIGTERM (143) and SIGINT (130), so an
# operator stop is NOT a "successful" exit and launchd does not relaunch it -- the
# "operator stop stays stopped" guarantee holds WITHOUT depending on bootout
# timing (Curator Finding 1). SIGKILL (--force) likewise terminates the job by
# signal, never a clean exit, so it is not respawned either. The bootout below is
# therefore belt-and-braces (it still unloads the definition so it does not come
# back at the next login). After the stop this script re-verifies that no daemon
# for THIS launchd label is still alive and exits non-zero if one is -- closing
# the inverted-#4011 silent-success hole where a failed bootout could leave a
# relaunched daemon dispatching while the script reported success.
#
# Autonomy-desired marker (#4011): a normal operator stop is INTENT to stop, so
# it removes the durable `autonomy-desired` marker loom-daemon-start.sh wrote and
# tears down the watchdog scheduler — the launchd LaunchAgent on Darwin
# (`launchctl bootout`), or the `<unit>-watchdog.timer` + `.service` pair on a
# systemd Linux host (`systemctl --user disable --now`, #4260 sub-issue D) —
# after that the watchdog correctly stays silent (no daemon is expected). But
# the internal stop that
# loom-daemon-update.sh performs is NOT operator intent to stop; it is a restart,
# so update.sh passes --restarting (or LOOM_DAEMON_STOP_KEEP_INTENT=1) and this
# script PRESERVES the marker + watchdog. Inferring restart-vs-stop would be
# wrong (every self-update would silently disarm the detector — the exact bug
# class #4011 fixes), so it must be an explicit signal.
#
# Test-only dry-run seam (#5501): a test proving "default label = the
# operator's real stop, behaviour unchanged" needs LOOM_LAUNCHD_LABEL /
# LOOM_WATCHDOG_LABEL to resolve to the REAL production values — but doing
# that against a live host is exactly the incident this seam exists to close
# (verifying #5131 booted the operator's real daemon, see #5501). With
# LOOM_DAEMON_STOP_DRYRUN=1, this script still RESOLVES the pid / launchd job /
# systemd unit it would act on (so the "what would this target" logic is fully
# exercised), but every MUTATING action against it — kill -TERM/-KILL, launchctl
# bootout (daemon + watchdog), systemctl --user disable --now (daemon +
# watchdog) — becomes a logged "DRY-RUN: would ..." line instead of a real
# syscall. Pair with LOOM_DAEMON_STOP_DRYRUN_LOG=<path> to capture those lines
# for a test to grep instead of parsing captured stdout.
#
# Usage:
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-stop.sh              Graceful stop (SIGTERM -> SIGKILL); clears the autonomy-desired marker
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-stop.sh --force      Skip the grace window (SIGKILL)

# Environment:
#   LOOM_PID_FILE                 #6386: the pid file to read, TIER 1 -- ahead of the
#                                 $PWD/machine-derived "<state home>/.daemon.pid".
#                                 Same precedence the daemon (daemon_pidfile.rs) and

#                                 loom-daemon-start.sh exports, so all four ends
#                                 always mean the SAME file. Before #6386 this script
#                                 ignored it and killed whatever $PWD's repo resolved
#                                 to -- which SIGTERM'd a live fleet dispatcher during
#                                 a test run that had explicitly pointed it elsewhere.
#   LOOM_DAEMON_STOP_GRACE_SECS   Grace window before SIGKILL (default 10)
#   LOOM_DAEMON_STOP_KEEP_INTENT  1/true/yes: preserve the autonomy-desired marker + watchdog (same as --restarting)
#   LOOM_DAEMON_STOP_DRYRUN       1/true/yes: TEST-ONLY. Resolve the target pid/launchd
#                                 job/systemd unit but never actually kill/bootout/disable
#                                 it — logs "DRY-RUN: would ..." instead (#5501). The
#                                 supported way to exercise default-label semantics
#                                 without touching a real supervised job.
#   LOOM_DAEMON_STOP_DRYRUN_LOG   Path to also append each dry-run action line to
#                                 (in addition to stdout), for a test to grep.
#   LOOM_LAUNCHD_LABEL            macOS only: the LaunchAgent label to bootout (default com.rjwalters.loom-daemon)

#                                 A start done with --no-launchd / LOOM_DAEMON_LAUNCHD=0
#                                 must get a stop that never reads or mutates the
#                                 machine-global launchd domain (issue #4078).
#   LOOM_DAEMON_SYSTEMD           Linux only: 0/false/no disables ALL systemd interaction

#   LOOM_MACHINE_CHECKOUT         Machine mode (Epic #3835 Phase 3b, #4229): set

#                                 this script. When set, the pid file is read from

#                                 $PWD's repo -- matching loom-daemon-start.sh, so
#                                 `loom stop` always targets the same machine-wide
#                                 daemon regardless of the invoking directory.
#                                 Direct invocation (no dispatcher) never sets it.

# and loom-daemon-watchdog.sh's resolve_pid_file() already use, and the value
# loom-daemon-start.sh exports (and bakes into the rendered plist / systemd
# unit) for the pid file the daemon actually claims.
#
# Before #6386 this script IGNORED LOOM_PID_FILE entirely and always read
# "$DAEMON_STATE_HOME/.daemon.pid" -- while honoring LOOM_SOCKET_PATH for the
# marker/loom-dir. That split resolution is what killed the fleet's live
# dispatcher for 11h: an Auditor run of the shell test suites from the LIVE
# checkout invoked this script with LOOM_PID_FILE pointed at a scratch file
# (and no `cd` into a fixture), so `find_repo_root` walked up from $PWD onto
# the real checkout, and the script SIGTERM'd + `rm -f`'d the REAL daemon's
# pid file that the caller had explicitly told it not to touch.
#
# On a real host this is a no-op: whatever LOOM_PID_FILE is present there was
# exported by loom-daemon-start.sh and already names the same file the tier
# below derives. It differs only when a caller DELIBERATELY names another file
# -- which is precisely the request that must be honored, not overruled by cwd.
#
# Deliberately NOT widened: the "Not in a Loom workspace" refusal above still
# runs first, so LOOM_PID_FILE narrows which pid file a stop targets but never
# grants a stop from a directory that previously refused outright. Letting the
# env var bypass that gate would ENLARGE the blast radius (an agent session
# exports LOOM_PID_FILE=<the real .daemon.pid> into every child it spawns, so a
# stray `loom-daemon-stop.sh` from /tmp would newly reach the live daemon) --
# the opposite of this fix's purpose. An empty value is skipped exactly like an
# unset one, which is how the suites pin a case to the derived tier on purpose.
