# land-resync-commit.sh - Conservatively land a "chore: resync installed Loom
# surfaces" change onto the PRIMARY clone's default branch (#6646).
#
# Background: `resync-installed.sh` never commits or pushes anything itself
# (see its own header) -- it only refreshes the installed `.loom/` /
# `.claude/commands/loom/` copies and, when the tree ends up dirty with only
# that output, PRINTS a suggested `git add && git commit` command. Before this
# script existed, actually LANDING that commit onto the primary clone's
# default branch was ad hoc agent behavior with no documented, safe recipe --
# and the natural-seeming approach (commit, then `git pull --rebase` /
# `git rebase origin/<default>` to reconcile with a moved origin, then push)
# is exactly what went wrong on 2026-09-15: an operator had just
# fast-forward-landed a not-yet-pushed local commit in the primary clone when
# a sweep committed its own resync change on top, rebased local `main` onto
# `origin/main` (which had gained several merged PRs), silently re-creating
# the operator's commit under a new SHA, and bypass-pushed the result past
# branch-protection required-checks. Nothing was lost (the recreated commit
# has identical content), but the operator's recorded SHA vanished from `git
# log`, a bypass push happened from automation, and establishing this was
# benign took a reflog read.
#
# That bypass push was NOT a `--force` push. It was a plain post-rebase
# `git push` that GitHub ACCEPTED -- because the pushing identity (the
# operator's own account / the fleet App, admin on the repo) is on the
# ruleset's bypass list -- and merely reported on stderr as
# `remote: Bypassed rule violations for refs/heads/main:`. A plain push is
# therefore only "rejected outright by branch protection" for an identity
# WITHOUT bypass rights; for one with them it goes straight through, and a
# script that discards push stderr on success never notices.
#
# This script replaces the ad hoc recipe with a deterministic, conservative
# one: it NEVER rebases, NEVER force/bypass-pushes over a commit it did not
# author, and treats a bypass push as a failure rather than a success.
#
#   1. If the working tree in the primary checkout has no resync-managed dirt
#      AND the default branch has nothing ahead of origin, it is a no-op
#      (exit 0).
#   2. If the dirty set includes anything OUTSIDE the known resync-managed
#      surfaces (`.loom/hooks|scripts|roles|docs|bin|runtimes/`,
#      `.claude/commands/loom/`, and the handful of single-file targets
#      resync-installed.sh itself resyncs), it refuses to commit ANYTHING --
#      an unrelated (possibly operator) change must never be swept into a
#      "chore: resync" commit. One exception: the credential-bearing class
#      (`.loom/tokens/`, `.loom/accounts.env`, `.loom/api-keys/`,
#      `.loom/claude-config/`, `.loom/gh-config/`, `.loom/gh-config-by-owner/`
#      -- #7818/#8005) is never staged, and while UNTRACKED it never blocks the
#      commit either -- it is silently excluded, unconditionally, even if a
#      host's `.gitignore` is missing the corresponding entries. A credential
#      path that is already git-TRACKED is the opposite case and STOPS the run
#      (#8004): no ignore rule can apply to a tracked path, so excluding it
#      here would leave a live credential committed with nothing but a log
#      line to say so.
#   3. Otherwise it commits the resync-managed dirt (if any), fetches origin,
#      and inspects every commit the primary checkout's default branch now
#      has that origin does not:
#        - If ANY of those commits was NOT authored by this checkout's own
#          configured git identity (`git config user.email` -- the Loom
#          automation identity; see check-git-identity.sh) -- i.e. an
#          operator's own unpushed work -- it STOPS: the resync commit stays
#          local, nothing is pushed, nothing is rebased, nothing is forced.
#          This is the fix for the incident above: an operator's in-flight
#          commit is never silently rewritten to reconcile with origin.
#        - Otherwise every commit ahead is this checkout's own automation.
#          A re-run is idempotent here: if an EARLIER run committed the
#          resync but then failed before landing it (fetch failure, side
#          branch push failure), the next run finds a clean tree with that
#          Loom-authored commit still ahead of origin and lands it instead
#          of reporting "nothing to land" and stranding it.
#   4. Before attempting a direct push it asks the forge (GitHub only)
#      whether the default branch has an active `pull_request` /
#      `required_status_checks` rule or legacy branch protection. If it does,
#      the direct push is SKIPPED regardless of whether this identity could
#      bypass it -- a plain push from a bypass-capable identity is exactly the
#      incident shape above. The rules lookup FAILS CLOSED: a non-zero exit
#      (rate limit, 5xx, DNS, a token without rulesets read) or an
#      unparseable answer is treated as "protected", because a transient
#      REST failure must not turn into a bypass push. It fails OPEN only when
#      there is no `gh` on PATH or the forge is Gitea (LOOM_FORGE_TYPE=gitea)
#      -- and on a definitive "no rules" answer. Otherwise a plain `git push`
#      is attempted;
#      ordinary git push semantics make this fast-forward-only by
#      construction (rejected if origin has advanced), and its stderr is
#      inspected even on success: a `Bypassed rule violations` warning is
#      treated as a failure (exit 4, loudly) so a bypass push can never
#      happen silently again.
#   5. If the direct push was skipped or rejected, it does NOT retry with a
#      rebase or a forced push. It lands the commit via a short-lived branch
#      + PR instead: the STABLE side branch `chore/resync-installed` (so a
#      repeated fallback updates the one open PR through create-pr.sh's
#      adopt-existing check rather than opening a duplicate per run), pushed
#      with `--force-with-lease` (forcing a throwaway side branch is fine;
#      only the default branch is sacred), labeled `loom:review-requested`
#      so it enters the normal Judge queue. It then resets the primary
#      checkout's default branch back to origin's current tip so it never
#      sits diverged waiting on that PR. No local side branch is created or
#      left behind.
#
# See `.loom/docs/troubleshooting.md` -> "Landing a resync commit on the
# primary clone (#6646)" for the full policy, the conditions under which this
# script's caller (a sweep, a human operator) may run it, and the reflog
# recipe for telling "this script did its documented job" apart from
# "something unexpectedly rewrote my branch".
#
# Usage:
#   ./.loom/scripts/land-resync-commit.sh              # commit + land
#   ./.loom/scripts/land-resync-commit.sh --dry-run     # preview only
#   ./.loom/scripts/land-resync-commit.sh --allow-worktree  # see below
#
# Like resync-installed.sh (#4563), this ALWAYS resolves and operates on the
# PRIMARY checkout (via `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`), never a linked
# issue/PR worktree, and refuses to run from one unless --allow-worktree (or
# LOOM_RESYNC_ALLOW_WORKTREE=1) is given -- committing/pushing the default
# branch from a Builder's worktree is never the right call.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 - Nothing to land, OR landed successfully (direct push, or via a
#       branch + PR when a direct push was skipped or rejected).
#   1 - Error: not a git repo, no resolvable default branch, wrong branch
#       checked out, non-resync dirt present, fetch failed, or the branch+PR
#       fallback itself failed (a PR-less pushed branch is reported so it can
#       be finished by hand). A commit made by this run stays local and is
#       picked up by the next run (see 3.).
#   2 - Usage error (bad argument).
#   3 - STOPPED on purpose: the resync was committed locally but NOT pushed,
#       because the primary checkout's default branch is ahead of origin by
#       one or more commits not authored by this checkout's own git identity
#       (presumed operator work). Nothing was rebased or force-pushed. A
#       human must reconcile (push, or rebase by hand) before the next
#       resync commit can land.
#   4 - BYPASS PUSH DETECTED: the direct push was accepted by the forge only
#       because this identity bypassed the default branch's protection rules
#       (the forge said so on stderr). The commit IS on origin -- this script
#       never force-pushes, so it does not undo it -- but the run is reported
#       as a failure so the bypass is never silent. Fix the identity/ruleset
#       (or whatever made the pre-check fail open: no `gh`, a Gitea forge).

# #7818 / #8005: the credential-bearing path class -- the Claude OAuth token
# pool, the repo-local account source, the per-host API-key pool, the harness
# auth store, and the daemon-owned GH_CONFIG_DIR trees holding live GitHub App
# installation tokens. These must NEVER be staged by this script,
# belt-and-braces alongside the loom-daemon-managed .gitignore entries:
# checked UNCONDITIONALLY, before is_resync_surface_path(), so a host whose
# .gitignore is missing or stale still cannot have this script sweep a live
# credential into a commit. This is what let a resync commit on
# rjwalters/anvil (2026-08-23) carry a live installation token into a public
# repo -- is_resync_surface_path() alone was already allowlist-based (so this
# script itself never staged the leak), but a matching path here is silently
# EXCLUDED (like a retired pure-copy path) rather than treated as blocking
# FOREIGN dirt, so an untracked credential file never stops an otherwise-clean
# resync from landing.
#
# The list is declared ONCE, as CREDENTIAL_PATTERNS in

# (init/credential_class_tests.rs fails CI if the two disagree). It cannot be
# read from the daemon at runtime: a consumer repo has no post_init.rs, and the
# installed binary is exactly what is stale on the hosts this guards (#7818).
# Contract: a trailing `/` is a directory (itself + everything under it);
# anything else is an exact file path.
