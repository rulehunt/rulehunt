# Loom PR Worktree Helper - Create a dedicated review worktree for a PR.
#
# Usage:
#   ./.loom/scripts/pr-worktree.sh <PR_NUMBER>
#
# Despite the name suggesting "external-fork / ad-hoc only" (the original,
# narrower use case, #3358), this is ALSO the script Judge/Doctor use for an
# ordinary Loom-issue PR (branch `feature/issue-<N>`) whenever no builder
# `issue-<N>` worktree already exists locally at review time — see
# `defaults/.claude/commands/loom/judge.md`'s "Worktree-Aware Code Access"
# section (#6264). In that shape the intended/documented case for
# `feature/issue-<N>` branches is `worktree.sh <ISSUE_NUMBER>` (below); this
# script's own worktree/branch-name mismatch (a `pr-<N>` directory holding a
# `feature/issue-<N>` branch) is exactly why a leftover review worktree could
# be missed by `merge-pr.sh`'s cleanup — fixed there, not here, by #6264.
#
# Typical uses:
#   - External-fork PRs (e.g., jperla/loom:fix/claude-code-2.1-compat)
#   - Ad-hoc branch names that don't include a Loom issue number
#   - A Judge/Doctor review of a Loom-issue PR with no local builder worktree
#
# For Loom-issue PRs whose branch IS `feature/issue-<N>` AND a builder
# worktree may already exist, prefer:
#   ./.loom/scripts/worktree.sh <ISSUE_NUMBER>
#
# What it does:
#   1. Fetches the PR's branch into a local tracking branch via `gh pr checkout`
#      INSIDE the new worktree (not in the orchestrator's main worktree)
#   2. Creates .loom/worktrees/pr-<PR_NUMBER>/ on a placeholder branch first,
#      then runs `gh pr checkout` from inside it so the PR branch is only
#      ever checked out in the dedicated worktree
#   3. Writes a `.loom-managed` sentinel so merge-pr.sh / loom-clean will
#      remove the worktree on PR merge
#
# Known failure mode (#6264, reproduced): if the PR's branch is ALREADY
# checked out in another local worktree (most commonly this same PR's
# `issue-<N>` builder worktree — git refuses the same branch in two
# worktrees at once), step 2's `gh pr checkout --force` fails loudly
# (non-zero exit, git's "already used by worktree" error) and this script
# exits 1. Callers MUST check this script's exit code rather than assuming
# the printed path is ready to evaluate; merge-pr.sh's cleanup no longer
# depends on the branch actually having switched (#6264 — it checks by
# path, not by branch state).
#
# #6594: the collision above is now detected up front (before this script
# ever creates a directory) by resolving the PR's head branch via `gh pr
# view` and checking `git worktree list` for an existing checkout of it —
# in that case the script fails fast and points the caller at the existing
# worktree instead of creating a `pr-<N>` one. If that up-front check can't
# resolve the head branch (e.g. a transient API hiccup) and the collision is
# only discovered later via the `gh pr checkout --force` failure, the
# partially-created worktree is removed via `git worktree remove` before
# this script exits — it is no longer left behind on disk.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 = success (worktree exists at the expected path, PR branch checked out)
#   1 = failure (error printed; a `pr-<N>` worktree this run created for a
#       failed checkout is removed before exiting — see #6594 — so it should
#       NOT still exist afterward, though a best-effort `git worktree remove`
#       can itself fail, in which case a warning names the manual cleanup
#       command)
#   2 = invalid arguments

Loom PR Worktree Helper

Usage: ./.loom/scripts/pr-worktree.sh <PR_NUMBER>

Creates an isolated worktree at .loom/worktrees/pr-<PR_NUMBER>/ for a PR
whose branch doesn't fit the `feature/issue-<N>` convention (typically
external-fork PRs). The PR's branch is checked out inside the worktree —
never in the orchestrator's main worktree.

For Loom-issue PRs (branch = feature/issue-<N>), use worktree.sh instead.

Exit codes:
  0 = worktree ready at .loom/worktrees/pr-<PR_NUMBER>/
  1 = failure
  2 = invalid arguments
