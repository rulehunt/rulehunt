# check-main-freshness.sh - Warn when local default branch is behind OR ahead
# of origin.
#
# This is a NON-BLOCKING, advisory check. During a long-running /loom:sweep
# session, other PRs can merge to origin's default branch — and because the
# installed .loom/scripts/ and .loom/hooks/ copies are synced from defaults/
# at install time, a local default branch that has drifted behind origin means
# the session may be executing STALE orchestration scripts that silently lack
# recently-merged logic (see #3770 for the incident: worktree.sh --base (#3742)
# and merge-pr.sh auto-reconcile (#3752) were absent from the copies the session
# was actually running, even though both had merged to origin/main).
#
# Ahead is the more dangerous direction (#5182): worktree.sh sets
# BASE_REF="origin/$DEFAULT_BRANCH", so every builder worktree branches off
# origin, not local. Unpushed local commits are invisible to every builder
# dispatched this session — a silent, wave-wide correctness gap, not just
# stale tooling.
#
# It is invoked at the start of /loom:sweep, alongside check-host-sleep.sh
# (#3350). It MUST NOT block — even if git / the network fails, it returns 0 and
# orchestration proceeds. It NEVER auto-pulls, merges, or resets — read-only.
#
# Usage:
#   ./.loom/scripts/check-main-freshness.sh         # print warning (or nothing) and exit 0
#   ./.loom/scripts/check-main-freshness.sh --quiet # suppress the stdout one-liner
#   ./.loom/scripts/check-main-freshness.sh --help  # show usage
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 - Always. This script is advisory; it never blocks Loom.
#
# See also: check-host-sleep.sh (#3350) — the sibling pre-flight advisory this
# script mirrors in structure and contract.

# ---------- resync precondition check (#6202) ----------
#
# Every remediation this script prints for "stale installed surfaces" tells
# the reader to run `resync-installed.sh`. That script needs a defaults/
# SOURCE tree to sync from, resolved (in priority order) from:
#   1. $REPO_ROOT/defaults/{hooks,scripts}   (this checkout IS the Loom source repo)
#   2. .loom/loom-source-path                (a sidecar written by install.sh /
#                                              install-loom.sh; gitignored by design
#                                              — it holds a machine-local path)
#   3. install-metadata.json's "loom_source" (legacy compat; #5624 stopped writing
#                                              this field, so it is dead for any
#                                              post-#5624 install)
#
# None of these exist on a checkout that never ran the Loom installer locally —
# a fresh developer clone, a CI checkout, or any machine that received the repo
# rather than installing into it. On exactly that population, `resync-installed.sh`
# fails on first use with "Could not locate a defaults/ source tree to sync
# from" — discovered only AFTER following this script's own remediation, not
# before (#6202). Mirror resolve_defaults()'s resolution order here (read-only,
# best-effort) so the gap can be surfaced up front instead.
#
# A candidate root is only usable if it has SOMETHING under defaults/ to sync
# from — `-d "$root/defaults"` alone is not sufficient (#6780): a sidecar or
# metadata path can point at a directory that still exists (unlike a fully
# vanished clone) but is stale, empty, or was never a real Loom checkout, e.g.
# a scratch clone emptied without removing the directory itself. Requiring a
# populated `defaults/hooks` or `defaults/scripts` mirrors the dogfood rung's
# own check and keeps this read-only mirror in lockstep with
# resolve_defaults() in resync-installed.sh — otherwise this precondition
# check can report "met" for a root that resync-installed.sh would actually
# resolve to a source tree with nothing under it, silently producing a false
# "already in sync" result instead of the loud failure an unresolvable source
