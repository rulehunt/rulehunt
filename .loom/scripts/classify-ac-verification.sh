# classify-ac-verification.sh - Champion's out-of-band acceptance-criteria gate
# (#6883).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# Champion's "Step 4: Verify Issue Auto-Close" converts "PR merged" into "issue
# done". That inference is sound when every acceptance criterion is something CI
# can check. It is UNSOUND when a criterion names a verification the suite
# structurally cannot perform -- a live external source, a real scheduled run,
# or an observation over time. In the incident behind #6883 a filter silently
# dropped items, the regression test FABRICATED the external payload the fix
# assumed, the suite went green, Champion closed the issue, and the item kept
# being dropped on the very next real run. The AC had said, close to verbatim,
# "confirm the dropped item is processed on the next real run" -- and nothing in
# the pipeline noticed that step had never been performed.
#
# This script is the mechanical half of the fix: it reads an issue body, finds
# its acceptance-criteria checklist, and classifies each item as CI-checkable or
# as requiring out-of-band verification, using a fixed, documented phrase
# vocabulary (below) rather than unstructured judgment. It then looks for the
# `<!-- loom:ac-verified sha=<head> -->` evidence marker that a Builder, author,
# or Judge posts to assert the out-of-band step was actually performed.
#
# The prose contract this enforces lives in
# `defaults/.claude/commands/loom/champion-pr-merge.md`, Step 4 -> "Out-of-Band
# Acceptance-Criteria Gate". Keep the OUT_OF_BAND_PHRASES vocabulary below in
# sync with the phrase list documented there -- this is the enforcement side,
# that doc is the human-readable side.
#
# ASYMMETRY OF THE TWO ERROR DIRECTIONS (why the vocabulary is tuned the way it
# is). A false NEGATIVE reproduces the exact incident: an unmet criterion is
# closed out silently and nobody ever learns. A false POSITIVE leaves an issue
# open with a comment naming the criterion, which any human -- or a one-line
# evidence marker -- clears in seconds. The costs are not symmetric, so where a
# phrase is genuinely ambiguous this vocabulary keeps it. What it does NOT do is
# reach for bare words (`live`, `real`, `run`, `verify`, `production`), which
# appear in ordinary engineering prose constantly and would flag nearly every
# issue -- same instruction-shaped-fragment discipline warn-operator-gated.sh
# applies to its own PHRASES vocabulary.
#
# Usage:
#   # Forge mode (what Champion runs):
#   classify-ac-verification.sh --issue <N> [--pr <N>] [--repo <nwo>] [--head-sha <sha>]
#
#   # Hermetic mode (what the tests drive; no forge calls):
#   classify-ac-verification.sh --body-file <path> [--evidence-file <path>] [--head-sha <sha>]
#
# Options:
#   --issue <N>          Issue whose acceptance criteria are classified (forge mode).
#   --pr <N>             PR being merged. Supplies the head SHA the marker must
#                        carry, and its body+comments are searched for the marker
#                        alongside the issue's.
#   --repo <nwo>         Repo owner/name (optional; defaults to the current repo).
#   --head-sha <sha>     Override the head SHA the marker is checked against.
#                        Required in hermetic mode when an evidence file is given.
#   --body-file <path>   Read the issue body from a file instead of the forge.
#   --evidence-file <path>  Read the marker-search text (comments, PR body) from
#                        a file instead of the forge.
#   --help,-h            Show this help.
#
# Output (stdout, one tab-separated line per OUT-OF-BAND criterion; silent when
# there are none):
#   <matched phrase>\t<criterion text, whitespace-normalized across wrapped lines>
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  CLEAR         - an AC checklist was found; no item requires out-of-band
#                      verification. Champion closes as it always has.
#   10 NO-AC         - no acceptance-criteria checklist found at all. Champion's
#                      existing purely-mechanical Step 4 behavior is unchanged --
#                      this is the common case and must stay a no-op.
#   11 SATISFIED     - out-of-band criteria found AND a current-SHA
#                      `loom:ac-verified` marker is present. Champion closes.
#   12 UNVERIFIED    - out-of-band criteria found and NO marker. Champion HOLDS
#                      the close (reopening if GitHub already auto-closed) and
#                      comments, quoting the criteria printed on stdout.
#   13 STALE-MARKER  - out-of-band criteria found; a marker exists but its SHA is
#                      not the PR's head. Same HOLD action as 12: the evidence
#                      describes a tree that is not the one being merged.
#   1  ERROR         - usage / precondition failure. FAILS CLOSED: the caller must
#                      treat this like 12 (hold and report), never like 0 --
#                      "the classifier could not run" is not "the criteria are met".

#
# Instruction-shaped fragments, matched case-insensitively as substrings of ONE
# acceptance-criterion item (the bullet plus its wrapped continuation lines,
# joined and whitespace-normalized). Grouped by the three failure shapes #6883
# names; the groups are documentation only -- matching iterates the array in
# declared order so the reported phrase is deterministic for a criterion that
# matches more than one.
#
# DELIBERATELY EXCLUDED bare words, and why: `live` ("live reload"), `real`
# ("real-world example"), `run` ("run the test suite"), `verify` ("verify the
# output"), `production` ("production build"), `manual` ("manual page"),
# `observe` ("observe the invariant"), `end-to-end` (an end-to-end *test* is
# ordinarily CI-checkable). Each of those appears in ordinary acceptance-criteria
# prose constantly; a bare-substring vocabulary built from them would flag
# essentially every issue and train Champion's readers to ignore the gate.

# ---- acceptance-criteria checklist extraction (extracted by tests) ----
#
# An "acceptance-criteria checklist" is: every markdown task-list item
# (`- [ ]` / `- [x]` / `* [ ]`, any indentation) that appears under a heading
# whose text contains "acceptance criteria" (case-insensitive), up to the next
# heading of ANY level. This deliberately covers the several headings this fleet
# actually emits -- "## Acceptance Criteria", "## Suggested acceptance criteria",
# "### Sharpened Acceptance Criteria" -- and deliberately does NOT sweep every
# checkbox in the body: `## Test Plan` and `## Dependencies` checklists are other
# roles' machinery (Judge's test-plan posture is explicitly non-blocking) and
# folding them in here would hold issues on steps this gate has no standing to
# gate. A body with no such heading yields no items at all -> exit 10.
#
# A criterion's text is its bullet line plus every following line that is not
# blank, not a new task-list item, and not a heading -- markdown's own wrapped-
# continuation shape, which the Curator's own sharpened ACs use heavily. Lines
# are joined with single spaces and whitespace-collapsed so the reported text is
# one greppable line.
#
# CHECKED BOXES ARE NOT EVIDENCE. A `- [x]` item is classified exactly like
# `- [ ]`. The incident this gate closes is precisely a case where the author who
# checked the box was the person whose assumption was untested; a checkbox
# carries no author, no timestamp, and no tree binding. The `loom:ac-verified`
# marker does carry all three, and it is the only thing that satisfies this gate.
