# check-verified-corrections-preserved.sh - Diff-before-rewrite guard for the
# Curator's append-only "## Verified corrections" convention (#4135).
#
# Why: Curator's inter-phase handoff is prose that gets rewritten in place. A
# re-curation pass that regenerates an issue body wholesale can silently drop
# a *verified* finding from an earlier pass in favor of a merely *plausible*
# one -- and the loss leaves no trace in the artifact the next agent reads.
# This happened on #4042: a first Curator pass verified three corrections
# against a live host and recorded them; a second pass rewrote the body and
# dropped all three, asserting the opposite of verified fact. The corrections
# survived only in an earlier *comment*, which is not what a Builder reads
# first. See `.loom/roles/curator.md` -> "Verified Corrections Are
# Append-Only" for the full convention this script enforces.
#
# What it checks: every paragraph under the OLD body's `## Verified
# corrections` heading (case-insensitive; up to the next `## ` heading or
# EOF) must still be present, verbatim after whitespace normalization,
# somewhere under the NEW body's `## Verified corrections` section. New
# paragraphs may freely be appended -- this only detects paragraphs that
# would be *lost*, exactly the "append-only" invariant.
#
# Usage:
#   check-verified-corrections-preserved.sh <old-body-file> <new-body-file>
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 - nothing lost (including the common case: OLD has no such section)
#   1 - a verified-corrections paragraph present in OLD is missing from NEW
#   2 - usage error (missing/unreadable arguments)
#
# This is a general-purpose diff tool, not forge-specific -- callers (a
# Curator re-curation pass, or a test suite) supply plain text files
# containing the OLD and proposed NEW issue body.
