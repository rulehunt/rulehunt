# check-defaults-version-bump.sh - Fail a PR that changes the watched
# surface (defaults/ by default) without either bumping VERSION or
# declaring an explicit no-surface-change marker (#5874, #6480).
#
# Why this exists: every file under defaults/ is copied into every
# consumer's installed .loom/{scripts,hooks,roles,docs,bin}/ +
# .claude/commands/loom/ surfaces at install time -- and is NOT refreshed by
# a `git pull` (that drift is what resync-installed.sh exists to remediate,
# per #3777). The only mechanical signal a consumer has that its installed
# copies are behind is a VERSION comparison: install.sh's own currency check,
# /repo:update-tools, and a fleet's `fleet-resync.sh --dry-run` all key off
# it. If a PR changes defaults/ without bumping VERSION, that signal silently
# lies -- exactly what happened when PR #5846 changed five role prompts plus
# a doc without touching VERSION: 23 fleet repos all reported
# "v0.18.0 -> v0.18.0" (current) while 59-85 installed surfaces per repo were
# actually stale.
#
# This is deliberately NOT trying to force semantic-version inflation on
# every doc typo or test-only edit under defaults/ -- an explicit marker lets
# an author declare "this change does not alter installed behavior" without a
# version bump.
#
# Consumer-repo use case (#6480): any repo shaped like Loom -- one that ships
# its own installable surface via an install.sh that copies files into other
# repos, keying its own currency checks off its own VERSION (e.g.
# rjwalters/repo's Repo Skills, rjwalters/anvil, rjwalters/squad) -- can
# reuse this exact script to gate its own VERSION on its own surface. Point
# --paths (or VERSION_BUMP_WATCH_PATHS) at that repo's installable paths
# instead of defaults/; everything else (the VERSION file name, marker text,
# exit codes) stays the same.
#
# Usage:
#   check-defaults-version-bump.sh --base <ref> [--head <ref>]
#                                   [--paths <p1> [<p2>...]]
#     --base <ref>   Git ref/sha to diff FROM (the PR's base commit, e.g. a
#                     fetched base sha, or origin/main for a local check).
#                     Required.
#     --head <ref>   Git ref/sha to diff TO. Defaults to HEAD.
#     --paths <p1> [<p2>...]
#                     One or more pathspecs to watch (repeatable -- each
#                     --paths flag may take multiple path arguments, and the
#                     flag itself may be passed more than once; all given
#                     paths accumulate). Defaults to `defaults/` so Loom's
#                     own CI job and every existing caller are unaffected.
#                     Also settable via the VERSION_BUMP_WATCH_PATHS
#                     environment variable (a whitespace-separated list),
#                     which --paths overrides when both are given.
#     --forbid-bump   Inverted mode (#7743): FAIL if this PR's own commits
#                     change the extracted version VALUE of any version-bearing file
#                     (package.json, mcp-loom/package.json, Cargo.toml,
#                     VERSION -- the same set scripts/version.sh manages);
#                     PASS otherwise, regardless of --paths /
#                     VERSION_BUMP_WATCH_PATHS (this mode does not gate on a
#                     watched path at all -- it gates on the version value
#                     itself, which is a property of the diff alone). Off by
#                     default so every existing caller -- Loom's own
#                     historical usage and every #6480 consumer-repo reuse --
#                     is byte-for-byte unchanged; only Loom's own
#                     `defaults-version-bump-check` CI job (.github/workflows/
#                     ci.yml) passes it. See "Inverted mode" below for why:
#                     version bumps now happen exactly once, automatically,
#                     in .github/workflows/version-bump-on-merge.yml -- a PR
#                     that hand-edits a version value is either duplicating
#                     that (harmless but pointless) or racing it (actively
#                     wrong, since the PR's value is stale the moment another
#                     defaults/-touching PR merges first).
#   check-defaults-version-bump.sh --help
#
# Inverted mode (--forbid-bump, #7743): the original mode above answers "did
# this PR bump VERSION", which #7743 documents as unsound in both directions
# (a bump anywhere in base..head satisfies it even when unrelated to this
# PR; a downgrade satisfies it too, since it only checks that VERSION
# *changed*, never that it increased) AND expensive even when sound --every
# concurrent defaults/-touching PR had to carry the same mechanical N-file
# diff and re-cut it whenever `main` moved. --forbid-bump asks a different,
# decidable-from-the-diff-alone question instead: "does this diff change a
# version-bearing file's VALUE at all" -- comparing each file's *extracted*
# version value between merge-base(--base, --head) and --head (not "did the
# raw file change", and NOT against --base directly: see the BASE_REF block
# in that code path for why base-branch drift would otherwise false-FAIL),
# so an unrelated Cargo.toml edit (a dependency bump, say) that never touches
# the `version = "..."` line still passes even though Cargo.toml itself is in
# the diff. This mirrors scripts/version.sh's own get_version_from_file()
# extraction rules per file type rather than importing that script, so this
# file stays a single self-contained script (its own #6480 header contract
# is "reuse this exact script" -- not "reuse this script plus a sibling").
#
# No-surface-change marker: a PR whose body OR whose HEAD-reachable commit
# messages (between --base and --head) contain the literal string
#     <!-- loom:no-surface-change -->
# is exempt even when a watched path changed and VERSION did not. Pass the PR
# body via the PR_BODY environment variable (GitHub Actions:
# `env: PR_BODY: ${{ github.event.pull_request.body }}`); the commit-message
# path needs no extra plumbing beyond --base/--head.
#
# CAVEATS for the calling CI job (#6577 -- both bit a real PR, #6576):
#   - Commit-message path: `git log --format=%B "${BASE}..${HEAD}"` can only
#     see commits actually present in the local checkout. A default
#     `actions/checkout@v7` run on a `pull_request` event fetches a SHALLOW,
#     single-commit checkout of the synthetic `refs/pull/<N>/merge` ref --
#     whose own commit message is "Merge <head> into <base>", not any real
#     branch commit -- so a marker placed in a genuine commit message is
#     invisible even though `--base`/`--head` were passed correctly. The
#     caller MUST check out with enough history (`fetch-depth: 0`, or at
#     least deep enough to reach `--base`) AND pass an explicit `--head`
#     (e.g. `ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}` +
#     `--head "${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}"`) instead of
#     relying on the default merge-ref checkout and the `--head` default of
#     the literal string "HEAD".
#   - PR_BODY path: this env var is a snapshot of the PR body captured in
#     the webhook payload that triggered THIS workflow run. A body edit made
#     after the triggering push (e.g. `gh pr edit --body ...` with no new
#     commit) does not retrigger the workflow, so a marker added to the body
#     post-push is invisible to any already-queued or already-run check --
#     and re-running the same workflow run (`gh run rerun`) replays the
#     ORIGINAL stored event payload, so it does NOT pick up a live body
#     edit either. If you add the marker to the body only, after already
#     pushing, push a new commit (an empty one is fine, e.g.
#     `git commit --allow-empty -m 'trigger marker check'`) to retrigger
#     `synchronize` with a fresh payload -- or just put the marker in a
#     commit message from the start, which the commit-message path (once
#     the caller fetches sufficient history, as above) picks up reliably.
#
# Exit codes (default mode):
#   0 - nothing under the watched paths changed in the diff, OR VERSION was
#       also changed, OR the no-surface-change marker is present.
#   1 - a watched path changed, VERSION was not, and no marker is present.
#   2 - bad usage (missing/invalid --base or --head, or an unknown argument).
#
# Exit codes (--forbid-bump mode):
#   0 - no version-bearing file's extracted value differs between
#       merge-base(--base, --head) and --head.
#   1 - at least one version-bearing file's extracted value differs.
#   2 - bad usage (same as above).
