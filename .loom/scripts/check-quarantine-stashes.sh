# check-quarantine-stashes.sh - Surface outstanding `loom-quarantine:` stashes.
#
# This is a NON-BLOCKING, advisory check, mirroring check-host-sleep.sh (#3350)
# and check-main-freshness.sh (#3770) in structure and contract.
#
# check-main-clean.sh --quarantine (see the Wave Lifecycle "Backstop" step in
# defaults/.claude/commands/loom/sweep.md) rescues contamination it finds in the
# primary clone's working tree into a labeled `git stash` entry rather than
# discarding it — by design, this never loses data. But the quarantine is
# recorded only in a structured JSON log line
# (.loom/logs/main-quarantine.log); nothing surfaces that a rescue stash is
# outstanding. Absent an operator who happens to notice, a labeled
# `loom-quarantine:` stash can sit indefinitely with nobody aware there is
# quarantined work to reconcile (#5185).
#
# refs/stash is shared across every worktree of a repo (not per-worktree —
# see the #4821 note in defaults/.claude/commands/loom/sweep.md), so this
# check is meaningful regardless of which worktree it runs from.
#
# It MUST NOT block — even if git fails, it returns 0. It is strictly
# read-only: it never pops, drops, or applies a stash.
#
# It must also never RECOMMEND one (#6076). Until #6076 the reconciliation
# hint printed `git stash apply <ref>   # or: git stash pop <ref>`, which
# contradicted the "Replay, don't pop" rule in
# defaults/docs/troubleshooting.md and handed every agent that read this
# advisory an ask-tier command: a bare `git stash pop` in the primary clone
# trips guard-destructive-generic.sh's `stash-scope:main-checkout` ask, which
# in a headless run has nobody to answer it and therefore stalls exactly like
# a deny. Because this advisory runs at sweep pre-flight (sweep.md
# "Quarantine Stash Check") on every run while any quarantine is outstanding,
# a single bad hint recurs daily — it accounted for the `git stash pop
# stash@{0} && git status --short` shape logged repeatedly in
# .loom/logs/guard-decisions.log over 2026-08-09..13.
#
# The hint therefore names only guard-transparent commands: `git stash show`
# (read-only), a replay into the OWNING issue worktree, and `loom-daemon
# stashes retire`. test-check-quarantine-stashes.sh asserts this mechanically
# so the regression cannot come back silently.
#
# Usage:
#   ./.loom/scripts/check-quarantine-stashes.sh          # print warning (or nothing) and exit 0
#   ./.loom/scripts/check-quarantine-stashes.sh --quiet   # suppress the stdout one-liner
#   ./.loom/scripts/check-quarantine-stashes.sh --help    # show usage
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 - Always. This script is advisory; it never blocks Loom.
#
# See also: check-host-sleep.sh (#3350), check-main-freshness.sh (#3770) — the
# sibling pre-flight advisories this script mirrors in structure and contract.

# a valid ref). %cr already gives a relative date independent of --date.
