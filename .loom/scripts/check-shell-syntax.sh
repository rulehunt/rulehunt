#!/usr/bin/env bash
# check-shell-syntax.sh - Assert installed shell surfaces PARSE (`bash -n`).
#
# #6162: an abandoned `git stash pop` conflict left live conflict markers
# (`<<<<<<< Updated upstream` / `=======` / `>>>>>>> Stashed changes`) in
# `defaults/scripts/spawn-claude.sh` in the primary checkout. Nothing asserted
# that installed shell surfaces actually parse, so the corruption sat
# undetected — and since `resync-installed.sh` copies `defaults/` into every
# consumer's `.loom/`, running a resync while that corruption was live would
# have shipped a non-parsing spawn script fleet-wide. This script is the
# narrow, cheap, deterministic guard the incident asked for: a shell script
# that fails `bash -n` is unambiguously broken, with no false positives.
#
# Two modes:
#   - Default (no --dir): scans the INSTALLED surfaces of the CURRENT repo's
#     primary worktree — `.loom/hooks/*.sh` (top-level only, matching the
#     resync/installer's own non-recursive hooks walk) and
#     `.loom/scripts/**/*.sh` (recursive, matching resync's recursive scripts
#     walk). Resolves the main worktree the same worktree-safe way
#     check-main-clean.sh does (`git rev-parse --git-common-dir`), so it can be
#     run from inside an issue worktree and still check the PRIMARY checkout's
#     installed copies, never the worktree's own (gitignored) .loom/.
#   - `--dir <path>` (repeatable): scans <path> recursively for `*.sh` files
#     instead of the installed-surface default. Used by resync-installed.sh to
#     validate the SOURCE tree (defaults/hooks, defaults/scripts) before
#     copying anything out of it (#6162 AC2) — checking the source is a
#     superset of "before any resync" (AC1): a source file that cannot parse
#     is refused before it ever reaches an installed copy.
#
# Usage:
#   ./.loom/scripts/check-shell-syntax.sh                 # scan installed .loom/hooks + .loom/scripts
#   ./.loom/scripts/check-shell-syntax.sh --dir <path>     # scan <path> recursively for *.sh (repeatable)
#   ./.loom/scripts/check-shell-syntax.sh --quiet          # only print failures (and the final summary)
#   ./.loom/scripts/check-shell-syntax.sh --help
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 - every scanned *.sh file parses cleanly (including "found zero files").
#   1 - usage error, or (default mode only) could not resolve the main worktree.
#   2 - one or more *.sh files failed `bash -n` — every offender is named with
#       its `bash -n` error.
#
# Notes:
#   - Only files literally named `*.sh` are scanned — this mirrors exactly
#     which files resync-installed.sh's hooks/scripts walks treat as shell
#     payload; a shebang-based scan would also have to define behavior for
#     extensionless executables that are not part of that walk (e.g.
#     `.loom/bin/loom`), which is a different surface than the one #6162
#     names as suggested acceptance criteria.
#   - `bash -n` only proves the file PARSES — it does not run it, so this is
#     safe to run against untrusted or half-written content and has no side
#     effects.
