# Test suite for defaults/hooks/guard-worktree-paths.sh (issue #4007)
#
# Usage: ./defaults/hooks/tests/test-guard-worktree-paths.sh
#
# Covers the #4007 rework from an env-only (LOOM_WORKTREE_PATH) worktree
# guard -- structurally inert on the daemon-dispatched sweep path, where
# Task-subagent builders share one process env with no per-subagent env
# injection (#3719) -- to a path-derived guard that works without any
# ambient env var:
#   - target inside a `.loom-managed` worktree -> allow
#   - target at the main repo root while a managed worktree exists -> deny
#   - relative path + cwd at main root, worktree exists elsewhere -> deny
#   - no `.loom-managed` sentinel anywhere -> allow (fail-open)
#   - path outside both the main checkout and any worktree (e.g. /tmp) -> allow
#   - the LOOM_WORKTREE_PATH fast path (tmux/manual sessions) is unchanged
#   - the guards.worktreeIsolation / LOOM_GUARD_WORKTREE_ISOLATION toggle
#     (env beats config; config beats default-on)
#   - fail-open contract: exit is always 0, and any denial emits well-formed
#     hookSpecificOutput JSON
#
# The hook under test is the canonical source at defaults/ (the version-
# controlled source of truth), copied into an isolated temp git tree so the
# hook's MAIN_ROOT/HOOK_ERROR_LOG resolve there (git-common-dir pins
# MAIN_ROOT to the temp root). Exit 0 = all pass, 1 = fail.
