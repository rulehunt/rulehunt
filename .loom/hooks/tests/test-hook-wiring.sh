# Test suite for defaults/hooks/hook-wiring.sh and the settings.json hook
# wirings that route through it (issue #7761).
#
# Usage: ./defaults/hooks/tests/test-hook-wiring.sh
#
# #7761: every PreToolUse hook entry used to end in `|| exit 0` — ALLOW — so a
# missing guard, a guard that had lost its executable bit, and a failed
# `git rev-parse --git-common-dir` all silently allowed the tool call with no
# stderr, no log line, and nothing to distinguish them from a guard that ran and
# decided to allow. This suite pins the replacement ladder:
#
#   rung 1  executable hook                 -> runs it (unchanged fast path)
#   rung 2  not a Loom workspace            -> silent allow (unchanged)
#   rung 3  present but not executable      -> runs it via `bash`, reports
#   rung 4  machine-level copy available    -> runs that (or stands down for an
#                                              already-wired user-scope entry)
#   rung 5  nothing anywhere                -> PreToolUse DENIES; other events
#                                              report loudly and allow
#
# plus the two properties the whole design rests on: the launcher NEVER exits
# non-zero, and no reachable path is silent inside a Loom workspace.
#
# Both subjects are resolved from the INSTALLED copy first (a Loom-installed
# consumer repo has no defaults/ tree at all), falling back to defaults/ for
# Loom's own source tree — the #6496 convention.
#
# Exit 0 = all pass, 1 = one or more failures.
