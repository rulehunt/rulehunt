# guard-loom-workflow.sh - PreToolUse hook for Loom-workflow-specific Bash guards
#
# Claude Code PreToolUse hook that intercepts Bash commands before execution.
# Receives JSON on stdin with tool_input.command and cwd fields.
#
# This hook carries the Loom-workflow-specific guards that were extracted from
# guard-destructive.sh (issue #3604), plus later Loom-specific additions:
#
#   1. LOOM: Prefer merge-pr.sh over 'gh pr merge'
#   2. LOOM: Block 'pip install -e' inside worktrees (issue #2495, #4079)
#   3. LOOM: Ask before real-registry-mutating `loom-daemon workspace
#      add|remove|set-priority` (issue #4326)
#   4. LOOM: Deny Bash writes that edit an INSTALLED Loom file in place in a
#      CONSUMER repo (issue #7995) — the Bash-idiom counterpart of the
#      Edit/Write denial in guard-worktree-paths.sh
#
# The generic repository-hygiene guards (catastrophic denies, SQL/cloud toggles,
# ASK patterns) live in guard-destructive.sh and are being migrated toward Repo
# Skills (rjwalters/repo#13). This file stays Loom-owned because these guards
# are specific to the Loom worktree/merge/daemon workflow.
#
# IMPORTANT: This hook only fires when Claude Code is invoked with:
#   --dangerously-skip-permissions  ← hooks FIRE (used by Loom agents)
#
# It does NOT fire with:
#   --permission-mode bypassPermissions  ← hooks SKIPPED entirely
#
# Output format (Claude Code hooks spec):
#   { "hookSpecificOutput": { "hookEventName": "PreToolUse", "permissionDecision": "deny|ask", "permissionDecisionReason": "..." } }
#
# NOTE: The "hookEventName": "PreToolUse" field is REQUIRED by Claude Code's
# PreToolUse hook schema. Without it, Claude Code silently discards the
# decision and the guard becomes inert (see issue #3550).
#
# Error handling: This script MUST never exit with a non-zero code or produce
# invalid output. Any internal error is caught by the trap, logged for
# diagnostics, and results in an "allow" decision to prevent infinite retry
# loops in Claude Code.

# directly from its SOURCE location (defaults/hooks/) the same expression would
# resolve to defaults/logs, depositing runtime telemetry inside the VENDORED

# scripts/check-vendored-private-refs.sh scans. Redirect that case to the repo's

# GH-PR-MERGE-REDIRECT FALSE-POSITIVE MASKING (issue #5109)
#
# The 'gh pr merge' redirect check below (guard tag loom:gh-pr-merge-redirect)
# used to grep the RAW, unmasked $COMMAND for the literal substring "gh pr
# merge" anywhere in the byte stream -- so it fired on commands that never
# actually invoked the disallowed CLI, only mentioned the phrase as inert
# text: a git commit message (passed via the CLAUDE.md-documented `-m
# "$(cat <<'EOF' ... EOF)"` heredoc idiom) that quoted the phrase as prose
# documenting the very rule this guard enforces, and a `gh issue list
# --search "..."` query whose search string happened to contain the phrase
# as text to search FOR, not a command to run.
#
# The two functions below build a MASKED copy of $COMMAND, used ONLY for the
# 'gh pr merge' substring check immediately below -- never for any other
# guard in this file, and never for decision-log redaction (that stays on
# strip_literal_text() above, unchanged). Composition matters: heredoc-body
# masking runs FIRST so any quote/backtick characters living inside a masked
# heredoc body can no longer interfere with the flag-value masking pass that
# runs second.
#
# Deliberately narrow, matching this repo's established masking conventions
# (see guard-destructive-generic.sh's mask_heredoc_bodies(), #5000/#5087):
# only two specific, well-understood-safe shapes are masked, and a command
# that merely EXECUTES the disallowed CLI through a wrapper -- `sh -c "gh pr
# merge 123"`, `bash -c 'gh pr merge 123'`, `eval "gh pr merge 123"` -- is
# UNCHANGED by either pass (neither `-c` nor `eval`'s argument is in the
# whitelist below) and still denies exactly as before. Masking only ever
# narrows what this ONE check can see; it never widens what it misses.
# =============================================================================

# Mask the BODY of a heredoc whose consuming command is either of two
# provably-inert forms:
#
#   1. `cat`, whose delimiter is quoted (`cat <<'EOF' ... EOF` /
#      `cat <<"EOF" ... EOF`, and the `<<-` tab-stripping variant), AND whose
#      `cat` invocation is captured by a command substitution ($()/backtick)
#      that is the value of a known non-executing text-data flag. This is
#      exactly the CLAUDE.md-documented idiom for multi-line commit/PR-body
#      text: `git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF' ... EOF)"`.
#   2. `git commit -F -` / `git commit --file=-` (issue #5328), whose
#      delimiter is likewise quoted AND which is PROVABLY the command that
#      consumes the heredoc (see the "provable statement anchor" rules in the
#      function below, hardened twice by #5333). `git commit -F -`/`--file=-`
#      reads its commit message from stdin and NEVER re-emits it anywhere --
#      unlike `cat`, there is no `git commit -F - | bash`-style escape hatch,
#      so ONCE `git commit` is proven to be the consuming command it is itself
#      the confinement proof, and case 1's capture-into-a-flag check (`capre`)
#      is not needed. That proof is load-bearing: every known bypass of this
#      branch has been a way to make some OTHER command (an interpreter
#      reading the heredoc as live script) look like `git commit`.
#
# A QUOTED delimiter guarantees bash performs no $()/backtick/$VAR expansion
# within the body, so the body is 100% literal text in both cases; case 1's
# flag-capture requirement additionally guarantees that literal text is used
# as inert data (a message/title/search value) rather than executed -- a
# guarantee case 2 gets for free from `git commit` itself never executing or
# forwarding its stdin.
#
# Deliberately narrower than "any heredoc" on THREE axes:
#   1. A heredoc feeding an INTERPRETER (`bash <<'EOF' ... EOF`, `sh <<EOF`)
#      is genuinely live code, so masking is gated on the word/phrase
#      immediately before `<<` being `cat` OR `git commit -F -`/`--file=-`.
#   2. `cat` never executes its body, but its stdout can still be routed INTO
#      a shell on the same command line -- `cat <<'EOF' | bash`, or a captured
#      `eval "$(cat <<'EOF' ...)"`. Masking those would blind this
#      catastrophic-tier guard to a real invocation, so masking of a
#      cat-heredoc is ALSO gated on `cat` being captured into a text-data
#      flag's $()/backtick value (see the `capre` confinement check inside
#      the function). This second gate does NOT apply to the `git commit -F
#      -`/`--file=-` form -- `git commit` cannot route its stdin onward to a
#      shell the way `cat`'s stdout can.
#   3. The `git commit -F -`/`--file=-` form is instead gated on a PROVABLE
#      statement anchor (#5333): the opener's own text and every physical line
#      before it must be free of shell quoting/escaping, so the boundary that
#      makes `git commit` the consuming command cannot be faked. Details and
#      the enumerated attack shapes live on `commit_stdin_re` below.
#
# Mirrors the #5087 lesson: only a heredoc block that is PROVABLY CLOSED
# inside the buffer (its bare delimiter line is found) gets its body masked.
# An unterminated/unrecognized opener masks NOTHING and the raw text flows
# through unchanged to the check below.

        # command -- an interpreter that runs the body as live script, e.g.
        # `bash -s -- ... <<'"'"'EOF'"'"'`, which takes `git`, `commit`, `-F`, `-` as
        # mere positional parameters ($1..$4) -- in front of a `git commit -F -`
        # decoy. Three anchors were tried and two proved forgeable:
        #
        #   v1 `(^|[^A-Za-z0-9_])`   -- any non-word char: `bash -s -- git
        #      commit -F - <<'"'"'EOF'"'"'` matched on the plain SPACE. Forged.
        #   v2 `(^|[;&|(BT])`        -- a control operator or start-of-LINE. Still
        #      forgeable three ways: (a) `^` is start of a PHYSICAL line, but a
        #      backslash-newline continuation joins physical lines into ONE
        #      logical command, so `bash -s -- \<newline>git commit -F - <<...`
        #      matched at column 1 while bash saw one `bash -s` command; (b) an
        #      ESCAPED operator (`bash -s -- \; git commit -F - <<...`) is a
        #      literal `;` argument to bash, not a separator; (c) a QUOTED
        #      operator or quoted newline (`bash -s -- "x ; git commit -F -
        #      <<'"'"'EOF'"'"'` with the quote closing later) does the same.
        #      A fourth, unrelated to the anchor: the v1/v2 middle-token class
        #      `[^ \t]+` swallowed metacharacters, so `git commit -a;bash -s --
        #      -F - <<...` matched as if it were one git command.
        #   v3 (current) -- an operator/start-of-line anchor that is PROVEN
        #      unquoted and unescaped, by requiring the whole prefix to be
        #      shell-inert:
        #        * `commit_stdin_re` restricts the tokens between `commit` and
        #          `-F -`/`--file=-` to a metacharacter-free charset, closing (d).
        #        * `commit_pre_safe_re` requires EVERY character of the opener
        #          line before `<<` to come from a charset with no quote (SQ/DQ/
        #          backtick), no backslash and no expansion character, so any
        #          `;`/`&`/`|`/`(` matched by the anchor is necessarily a real
        #          control operator -- closing (b) and the same-line half of (c).
        #        * `prefix_inert[]` (computed in END) requires every physical
        #          line BEFORE the opener to be free of quotes, backslashes and
        #          heredoc openers, so the newline that `^` anchors to is a real
        #          command terminator: it cannot be a backslash-continuation
        #          (no backslash exists to continue with -- closing (a)), it
        #          cannot sit inside a multi-line quoted string (no quote is

# TWO-HOP HEREDOC-VARIABLE INDIRECTION MASKING (issue #5172)
#
# mask_cat_heredoc_bodies() above only recognizes a cat-heredoc captured
# DIRECTLY by a known text-data flag/field, e.g. `-m "$(cat <<'EOF' ... EOF)"`.
# It does NOT recognize the equally common two-STEP idiom of assigning that
# heredoc to a shell variable first, then referencing the variable later:
#
#   BODY="$(cat <<'EOF'
#   ...prose that quotes the disallowed phrase as a documented example...
#   EOF
#   )"
#   gh api "repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/N/comments" -f body="$BODY"
#
# Here the literal phrase text lives in the heredoc body at DEFINITION time;
# the LATER reference is only the variable name ($BODY), never the phrase
# itself. Raw substring scanning still catches the phrase living in the
# heredoc body, even though nothing in the command actually executes it — the
# false-positive class this function closes.
#
# mask_var_assigned_heredoc_bodies() masks such a heredoc's body at its point
# of DEFINITION, but ONLY when it can prove every LATER reference to that same
# variable -- in ANY bash form: $VAR, ${VAR}, or any parameter-expansion
# variant ${VAR:0:100} / ${VAR#pat} / ${VAR:-def} / ... (#5297) -- elsewhere in
# the command is itself confined to a known non-executing text-data flag/field
# value, AND that at least one such reference was actually observed. A variable
# with ZERO detectable references is never masked: it may be reached through an
# indirection this literal scan cannot see (`${!REF}`, `eval` of a computed
# name), so leaving the body unmasked (and thus scanned/denied) fails safe. The
# confinement allowlist is the same as
# mask_cat_heredoc_bodies/mask_data_flag_values (-m/--message/--body/--notes/
# --title/--comment/--search, or `gh api -f <field>=`). If ANY later
# reference to the variable falls OUTSIDE that confined context -- `eval
# "$VAR"`, `bash -c "$VAR"`, the bare variable used as a command, or simply no
# recognizable safe usage -- the heredoc body is left COMPLETELY UNMASKED, so
# a genuine two-hop bypass (assign `gh pr merge 123` to a variable via
# heredoc, then `eval` it) still denies exactly as before. Masking only ever
# narrows what this ONE check misses; it never widens it -- same invariant as
# every other masking function in this file.
#
# A variable reference that falls INSIDE a candidate heredoc's OWN body (the
# variable mentioning its own name as prose, e.g. describing this very fix) is
# excluded from the confinement scan -- it is inert text, not a later live
# reference -- by blanking every candidate's body span before scanning.

# Mask quoted POSITIONAL arguments (no preceding flag name) to a small
# allowlist of known non-executing commands/scripts (issue #5155, extending
# the #5115 fix above; extended again for echo/printf narration by #6400;
# extended again for jq filter programs by #6464). mask_data_flag_values only
# recognizes text following a named flag; it has no effect on a script whose
# free-text arguments are purely positional, e.g.
# `./.loom/scripts/check-duplicate.sh "TITLE" "DESCRIPTION"`, `grep -n
# "pattern" file`, `echo "some narration text"`, or
# `jq -s '[.[] | select(.command | test("^\\s*gh pr merge\\s"))] | length' file`.
# `grep`/`egrep`/`fgrep`/`rg` and check-duplicate.sh never EXECUTE a
# positional argument -- they only read it as search/dedup text -- so masking
# a quoted argument immediately following one of these command names
# (optionally after short flags, e.g. `grep -n "..."`) can never blind this
# catastrophic-tier guard to a real invocation. A command that WRAPS the
# phrase and then executes it -- `sh -c "gh pr merge 123"`, `bash -c '...'`,
# `eval "..."` -- is NOT in this allowlist and stays fully visible to the
# merge-redirect grep below, exactly as before.
#
# `echo`/`printf`/`jq` are different from the other allowlisted commands:
# their own quoted text CAN become a real execution vector, when piped into
# an interpreter (`echo "gh pr merge 123" | bash`,
# `jq -n -r '"gh pr merge 123"' | bash`) or produced by a command
# substitution consumed by one (`eval "$(echo ...)"`,
# `eval "$(jq -n -r '"gh pr merge 123"')"`). jq's positional argument is a jq
# FILTER PROGRAM, not literal output text -- its output only equals the
# argument text in the narrow, deliberately-crafted case of a `-n`/`--null-input`
# invocation whose filter is itself a string literal -- but that narrow case is
# exactly as real a bypass vector as echo/printf's, so jq gets the identical
# restriction rather than the unrestricted grep/rg treatment. So, unlike the
# unrestricted allowlisted commands, an echo/printf/jq match is masked ONLY
# when BOTH hold:
#   1. The echo/printf/jq invocation is not itself nested inside a `$(...)`/
#      backtick command substitution (a strong signal its output is about to
#      be consumed by something else, e.g. `eval`) -- decided from a
#      precomputed per-position nesting-depth map over the whole buffer, NOT
#      from the single character adjacent to the token, so `eval "$( echo
#      ... )"` and its newline-separated form cannot slip through (#6400).
#   2. The full run of quoted arguments is not immediately followed by a
#      pipe (`|`) into another command -- `echo "..." | bash` /
#      `jq ... | bash` must stay fully visible.
# grep/rg/check-duplicate.sh are unaffected by either restriction: they never
# execute a positional argument regardless of context, so they keep the
# original, simpler masking behavior.
#
# Masks EVERY quoted argument that directly, consecutively follows the
# command+flags (separated only by whitespace) -- not just the first -- so
# multi-positional-arg scripts like check-duplicate.sh's `TITLE DESCRIPTION`
# signature get both arguments masked. Masking stops at the first token that
# is not a quoted string (a bare filename, `&&`, `|`, etc.), leaving anything
# after that boundary -- including a real `gh pr merge` invocation chained
# onto the same line -- fully visible.

    # subshell used as an earlier sibling statement inside a still-open
    # `$(...)` silently un-nested everything after it:
    #     eval "$( (true); echo "gh pr merge 123" )"
    # the `)` of `(true)` closed the counter, the later echo read as
    # not-nested, its argument was masked, and this ASK-tier guard ALLOWED a
    # command that really does eval a live `gh pr merge` (#6400 re-review).
    # The same conflation broke `$(( ... ))` arithmetic siblings.
    #
    # `respect_q` selects the lexing interpretation:
    #   0 -- quote-blind: every `(`, `)`, `$(` and backtick counts wherever it
    #        appears. Cannot be desynchronised by an unpaired quote character
    #        (an apostrophe inside a `#` comment line, say), but a `)` that
    #        merely sits inside a quoted string can pop a real level.
    #   1 -- quote-aware: single quotes are literal, double quotes suppress
    #        bare `(`/`)` (which are not syntax there), and `$(` re-lexes its
    #        body with a fresh quote state that is restored when its own `)`
    #        pops -- so `"$(foo)"` and `$( echo "a)b"; ... )` both track
    #        correctly.
    # Neither interpretation is sound on its own, so the caller takes the MAX
    # of the two maps. Over-reporting depth only ever WITHHOLDS masking, which
    # keeps the flagged phrase visible and denies -- the fail-safe direction;
    # under-reporting is what produces a silent bypass.
    #
    # `case ... esac` gets its own tracking because a case PATTERN terminator
    # (`x)`) is the one common shell construct that writes a `)` with no
    # opener at all, so it would otherwise pop a level it never opened:
    #     eval "$( case x in x) :;; esac; echo "gh pr merge 123" )"
    # While a `case` is open on the current stack frame a `)` is treated as a
    # pattern terminator and pops nothing. Detection requires the literal word
    # `case` at a command position (start of buffer, or after a newline, `;`,
    # `&`, `|`, `(`, backtick or `{`), which keeps ordinary text such as
    # `X=$(grep case /etc/hosts)` from tripping it -- and a false positive
    # there would only WITHHOLD a pop, i.e. over-report, which is again the
    # fail-safe direction.
    #
    # Two further constructs write a `)` with no matching opener, closed by
    # #6408 in the same fail-safe (pop-withholding) style as `case`/`esac`:
    #
    #   * A `)` inside a `${...}` PARAMETER EXPANSION, e.g.
    #         eval "$( x=${y//)/}; echo "gh pr merge 1" )"
    #     `${...}` gets its own per-frame counter (`braceexp[psp]`, exactly
    #     mirroring `casecnt[psp]`): `${` increments it, a `}` decrements it
    #     while it is positive, and a `)` arriving while it is non-zero pops
    #     nothing. Per FRAME, not global, so a real command substitution inside
    #     the expansion (`${a:-$(date)}`) still opens and closes normally --
    #     its `$(` pushes a fresh frame whose own counter starts at zero.
    #
    #   * A `)` inside a HERE-DOCUMENT BODY that the earlier
    #     mask_cat_heredoc_bodies / mask_var_assigned_heredoc_bodies passes do
    #     not cover (a bare `cat <<E`, not captured into a text-data flag):
    #         eval "$( cat <<'"'"'E'"'"'
    #         )
    #         E
    #         echo "gh pr merge 1" )"
    #     On an unquoted `<<`/`<<-` the delimiter word is parsed (quoted or
    #     bare) and the body is located by scanning forward for its terminator
    #     line. Across that span a POP FLOOR (`popfloor`) is raised to the
    #     current stack pointer, so a `)` in the body can only pop levels the
    #     body itself opened -- never the enclosing `$(`. The body is still
    #     lexed normally otherwise: an unquoted-delimiter body IS expanded by
    #     bash, so a `$(` inside it is genuinely live and must keep raising
    #     depth. `<<<` (here-string) is explicitly not a heredoc opener, and an
    #     opener whose terminator line is absent from the buffer skips nothing
    #     at all -- so an arithmetic left-shift (`$((1<<2))`) misread as an
    #     opener cannot freeze the map.
    #
    # Both are monotone: they only ever WITHHOLD a pop, i.e. over-report depth,
    # which withholds masking and keeps the flagged phrase visible. That is the
    # same fail-safe direction as everything else in this function -- but it is
    # still a false positive if it reaches ordinary narration, so both are
    # bounded (per-frame counter, per-body floor) rather than global latches.

# =============================================================================
# FOR-LOOP ITEM-LIST MASKING (issue #6866, #6464 Instance 1)
#
# The three masking functions above all neutralize a literal that appears
# DIRECTLY adjacent to its own safe usage -- a flag value, a positional
# argument, a heredoc body captured by a text-data flag/field, or (via
# mask_var_assigned_heredoc_bodies) a heredoc assigned to a variable and
# dereferenced later. None of them recognize this shape, reported in #6464:
#
#   for q in "aws s3 rb" "some-search-term" "gh pr merge redirect"; do
#     echo "=== $q ==="
#     gh issue list --state open --search "$q" --limit 10 ...
#   done
#
# Here the disallowed phrase is a literal ITEM in a `for VAR in "..." "...";
# do` word list; it is only reachable later via `$VAR`/`${VAR}` inside the
# loop body. No `gh`, `pr`, or `merge` subcommand is ever invoked. The literal
# and its (safe) use live in two different places connected only by a shell
# variable name -- structurally analogous to the heredoc-variable problem
# above, but with a different capture syntax (a bare, quoted word list
# instead of a heredoc body) and a different safe-usage shape (the reference
# can be embedded inside a larger quoted string, e.g. `"=== $q ==="`, not
# just as the entirety of a flag's value).
#
# mask_for_loop_list_items() masks a `for`-loop's item list at its point of
# DEFINITION, but ONLY when every `$VAR`/`${VAR}` reference to that loop
# variable anywhere else in the command is proven safe. Rather than
# re-implementing the safe-context allowlist (flags, positional-arg commands,
# the echo/printf nested-substitution and trailing-pipe restrictions, ...) a
# third time, confinement is decided by literally asking the two
# reference-site masking functions above: a scratch copy of the command (with
# this candidate's own item-list span blanked out, so its own literal text
# can never be mistaken for a live reference to its own variable name) is run
# through `mask_command_positional_args` then `mask_data_flag_values` --
# EXACTLY the two functions, in the same relative order, that the real
# `GH_PR_MERGE_SCAN_TEXT` pipeline below applies to reference sites. Both
# functions mask character-for-character (gsub(/./,"X",...) on each masked
# span), which preserves the LENGTH and POSITION of every character, so
# whether a given `$VAR` reference was masked can be read directly off the
# masked output at the same character offset it had in the scratch input --
# no separate anchor/flag/pipe regex needs to be duplicated here, and this
# stays automatically in sync with any future extension to either function's
# allowlist (e.g. adding `jq`, #6867).
#
# A reference is counted only via the exact "$VAR" / closed "${VAR}" (or any
# longer parameter-expansion prefix "${VAR...") forms, mirroring
# mask_var_assigned_heredoc_bodies's own reference scan -- including its
# "$VARX"/"${VARX" false-extension guard. The item list is masked ONLY when
# at least one reference was found AND every reference found was masked by
# the two reference-site functions. Zero detected references is NOT proof of
# safety (the variable may be reached through indirection this literal scan
# cannot see -- `${!REF}`, `eval` of a computed name, a shadowed name in an
# unrelated scope, ...), so a `for`-loop item list with no detected reference,
# or with even ONE unconfined reference, is left COMPLETELY UNMASKED --
# masking only ever narrows what this ONE check misses, it never widens it,
# same invariant as every other masking function in this file. Because the
# confinement scan runs over the WHOLE command buffer (not just the loop
# body), it is deliberately over-inclusive rather than under-inclusive: a
# same-named variable used unsafely anywhere else in the command (a shadowed
# outer scope, a sibling loop reusing the name, ...) also blocks masking --
# the fail-safe direction, never the reverse.
#
# Only two shapes are recognized, per the recommended approach in #6866:
# `for VAR in "item1" "item2" ...; do` on one line, and the same list ending
# the line (optionally with a trailing `;`) with `do` alone on the next line.
# Anything else (a C-style `for ((...))`, an unquoted/glob word list, a `do`
# on neither the same nor the very next line, an unterminated quote) is not
# recognized as a candidate at all and is left fully visible -- fail-safe by
# construction, not a masking decision.

# Workspace-registry guard toggle — default ON (issue #4326).
#
# The `loom-daemon workspace add|remove|set-priority` ask (below) is a useful
# default backstop against accidentally mutating the operator's real
# ~/.loom/workspaces.json, but — like every other category guard in this
# file — a repo/session can opt out via the same
# `guards.<name>` config key + `LOOM_GUARD_<NAME>` env override convention
# used throughout `guard-destructive-generic.sh` (sql_guard_enabled(),
# cloud_guard_enabled(), …). This is INDEPENDENT of `LOOM_WORKSPACES_PATH`
# (the sanctioned scratch-registry seam that allows a specific mutating
# command through regardless of this toggle) — this toggle instead disables
# the ask machinery entirely, for an operator who finds it pure friction.
#
# Resolution order (highest precedence first):
#   1. LOOM_GUARD_WORKSPACE_REGISTRY env var (0/false/no disables, 1/true/yes
#      forces on). Overrides config.
#   2. .loom/config.json (or a higher config-resolver tier) ->
#      guards.workspaceRegistry (default true when absent)
#   3. Default: true (guard on)
#
# Resolved LAZILY (only once a mutating `workspace` subcommand has already
# matched) and cached, mirroring every other toggle in this file. The config
# read is best-effort: any parse failure falls through to guard-ON.

    # <<'DELIM'`) is deliberately left unmasked, because #5122 showed a later
    # command on the same line can execute that file. That is still the right
    # call ("masking only ever narrows what this ONE check can see; it never
    # widens what it misses" -- see the block comment above
    # mask_cat_heredoc_bodies()), but it means writing prose that merely
    # quotes the phrase to a file this way denies with no hint that the
    # trigger was inert documentation, not a live invocation. When that shape
    # is present, name it explicitly so the false-positive case (an agent
    # documenting this very rule) isn't left guessing why an apparently-inert
    # command was denied.

# LOOM: Block pip install -e inside worktrees (issue #2495, hardened by #4079)
#
# Editable pip installs overwrite a global .pth file in site-packages.
# When multiple builders run in parallel worktrees, each 'pip install -e .'
# clobbers the .pth to point at its own worktree, causing all other Python
# processes to import from the wrong source tree.
#
# The second, worse failure mode (incident #4079, which motivated epic #4081):
# an editable install also drops FROZEN `<name> = <module>:main` console scripts
# into ~/.local/bin. Those outlive the package — they keep shadowing whatever is
# later installed under the same name on PATH, which is how a stale
# `pip install -e loom-tools` kept shadowing the Rust `loom-daemon` binary long
# after the Python package stopped being used. `loom-daemon-update.sh` warns
# about survivors; this guard stops new ones being created.
#
# This guard is NOT specific to Loom's own (now Python-free) tree — it protects
# any Python repo under Loom orchestration. The supported ways to run a
# worktree's own code without an editable install:
#   - `.loom/scripts/run-tests.sh`, which prepends the worktree's source root to
#     PYTHONPATH before invoking pytest; and
#   - `loom-daemon agent-spawn`, which pins PYTHONPATH into the spawned session
#     for repos whose worktree has a src/ layout it recognizes.

# LOOM: Ask before registry-mutating `loom-daemon workspace` commands
# (Issue #4326)
#
# `loom-daemon workspace add|remove|set-priority` mutate the machine-level
# workspace registry (Issue #3926), normally `~/.loom/workspaces.json` — a
# SHARED file, not scoped to any one repo/worktree/session. An ad-hoc
# verification step (a builder/auditor sweep exercising registry behavior)
# that invokes the real CLI without redirecting it leaves stray/incorrect
# entries in the OPERATOR's actual registry: #4326 found a leaked
# `/private/tmp/mig-test` entry sitting at dispatch priority 3 — ahead of
# every real managed repo — for most of a day, because the directory was
# deleted after registration without a matching `workspace remove`.
#
# `LOOM_WORKSPACES_PATH` (`loom-daemon/src/workspace_registry.rs`) already
# exists as the sanctioned scratch-registry seam — every daemon unit test
# points at it instead of the real file (see
# `defaults/docs/machine-dispatcher.md`). So this guard ASKS (never a hard
# deny — an operator legitimately managing their own real registry must still
# be able to proceed) whenever a mutating `workspace` subcommand runs with
# NEITHER the env var already set in the environment NOR an inline
# `LOOM_WORKSPACES_PATH=` assignment on the same command line. `workspace
# list` is read-only and is NEVER matched by this guard.

# (issue #7995 — the Bash-idiom half of the prose rule #7883 shipped)

# `guard-worktree-paths.sh` denies the same target through the Edit/Write

# Cost control: the substring pre-check is a handful of bash pattern matches on
# a string already in memory, and it is the FIRST thing evaluated — the
# tokenizer, the config read, and every filesystem stat are behind it, so a
# Bash call that never mentions a managed prefix pays nothing measurable.
#
# Both the repo-identity discriminator and the write-target extraction live in
