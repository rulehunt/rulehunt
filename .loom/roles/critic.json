Look for: unused dependencies, dead code, over-engineered abstractions, commented-out code, duplicated logic, and unnecessary features. If you find something concrete worth removing, create a GitHub issue with the `loom:critic-suggestion` label explaining what to remove, why it's bloat, and the benefits of removal. Be specific and provide evidence (e.g., grep results showing no usage).",
